header:Original paper
So the original paper is remarkedly simple and actually quite limited in it statement.
The setup is simple. You have $g(x) = 0$ (yes) for a very limited number of $x$ (with exponentially small probability if all x are uniformly likely).
$g(x)=1$ for the no instance of $x$. So $g(x)$ counts as energy value at each $x$.
Now instead of trying to search this system, we cool the system with $g$ considered as Hamiltonian.
Eventually, we know that we can cool system and convergence is exponential.
However, convergence ratio $\mu$ that is unproved in this paper. (The reason why comes below)
This is not even that much of an issue anyway - For this to work for any interesting problem, we would need reservoirs to be at polynomial inverse temperature.
This is very small temperature, and engineering it requires infinte regress of cooling, which doesn't work.
That is, we need our reservoirs to be exponentially close to ground states - largely impossible unless reservoirs are too simple to provide anything.
So we can stop here, and dismiss the possibility of using quantum cooling to solve NP-complete problems in largely unstructured ways.
But of course we probably aren't happy stopping here. Can we go further from the original paper?
header:Regret - how the paper should have been
The reservoir temperature is not the only crucial constraint preventing quantum cooling from solving any useful problem. 
The Fermi golden rule and unitarity considerations also provide a crucial constraint, suggesting why quantum cooling cannot solve most important problems.
header:Fermi golden rule and unitarity considerations (+ small corrections-like theorems)
To first order, any interaction transition amplitude is described by the Fermi golden rule. The following term basically determines transition probability
$$\sum_{yes,no,reservoir}|\langle yes|H_{int}|no\rangle|^2$$
So if this value can be sufficiently large, then we can guarantee good convergence ratio $\mu$.
But this seems implausible.
