header:Original paper
So the original paper is remarkedly simple and actually quite limited in it statement.
The setup is simple. You have $g(x) = 0$ (yes) for a very limited number of $x$ (with exponentially small probability if all x are uniformly likely).
$g(x)=1$ for the no instance of $x$. So $g(x)$ counts as energy value at each $x$.
Now instead of trying to search this system, we cool the system with $g$ considered as Hamiltonian.
Eventually, we know that we can cool system and convergence is exponential.
However, convergence ratio $\mu$ that is unproved in this paper. (The reason why comes below)
This is not even that much of an issue anyway - For this to work for any interesting problem, we would need reservoirs to be at polynomial inverse temperature.
This is very small temperature, and engineering it requires infinte regress of cooling, which doesn't work.
That is, we need our reservoirs to be exponentially close to ground states - largely impossible unless reservoirs are too simple to provide anything.
So we can stop here, and dismiss the possibility of using quantum cooling to solve NP-complete problems in largely unstructured ways.
But of course we probably aren't happy stopping here. Can we go further from the original paper?
header:Regret - how the paper should have been - RMT regime vs. FGR regime
The reservoir temperature is not the only crucial constraint preventing quantum cooling from solving any useful problem. 
There are two regimes.
header:Random Matrix Theory regime (strong coupling - quantum expander within energy shell)
Thre first regime is the strong coupling case with the global unitary (bath+system) governed by a random chaotic unitary in a random matrix model.
The Fermi Golden rule is inapplicable in this regime.
As a thermal operation, it has to respect conservation of total non-interaction energy, so we must define this unitary in light of each energy shell.
Within each energy shell, we have a quantum expander (optimal or sub-optimal) as a sub-channel.
Then thermal equilibration is achieved while leveraging maximal scrambling. We have fast convergence and equilibration.
Yes, RMT's maximal/exponential scrambling power is gone, but we still have polynomial equilibration time, relative to the number of qubits.
header:Fermi golden rule regime
To first order with weak coupling, any interaction transition amplitude is described by the Fermi golden rule.
The following term basically determines transition probability:
$$\sum_{yes,no,reservoir}|\langle yes|H_{int}|no\rangle|^2$$
This is most surely small value and decaying ratio is basically close to 1 - very slow decay.
