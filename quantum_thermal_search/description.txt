header:Original paper
So the original paper is remarkedly simple and actually quite limited in it statement.
The setup is simple. You have $g(x) = 0$ (yes) for a very limited number of $x$ (with exponentially small probability if all x are uniformly likely).
$g(x)=1$ for the no instance of $x$. So $g(x)$ counts as energy value at each $x$.
Now instead of trying to search this system, we cool the system with $g$ considered as Hamiltonian.
Eventually, we know that we can cool system and convergence is exponential.
However, convergence ratio $\mu$ that is unproved in this paper. (The reason why comes below)
This is not even that much of an issue anyway - For this to work for any interesting problem, we would need reservoirs to be at polynomial inverse temperature.
This is very small temperature, and engineering it requires infinte regress of cooling, which doesn't work.
That is, we need our reservoirs to be exponentially close to ground states - largely impossible unless reservoirs are too simple to provide anything.
So we can stop here, and dismiss the possibility of using quantum cooling to solve NP-complete problems in largely unstructured ways.
But of course we probably aren't happy stopping here. Can we go further from the original paper?
header:Regret - how the paper should have been
The reservoir temperature is not the only crucial constraint preventing quantum cooling from solving any useful problem. 
The Fermi golden rule and unitarity considerations also provide a crucial constraint, suggesting why quantum cooling cannot solve most important problems.
header:Fermi golden rule and unitarity considerations (+ small corrections-like theorems)
To first order, any interaction transition amplitude is described by the Fermi golden rule. The following term basically determines transition probability
$$\sum_{yes,no,reservoir}|\langle yes|H_{int}|no\rangle|^2$$
So if this value can be sufficiently large, then we can guarantee good convergence ratio $\mu$.
But this seems implausible - consider chaotic interaction. Then there are still exponentially many pathways of no-no transitions relative to no-yes transitions.
In fact, we can prove implausibility from the unitarity perspective. Suppose some initial state is cast as $\sqrt{1-\epsilon}|no\rangle+\sqrt{\epsilon}|yes\rangle$.
Then, unitary $U$ evolves respects norm such that for very small $\epsilon$, the entire final outcome is largely unaffected by initial parts of $|yes\rangle$.
With only initial $|no\rangle$ parts, the 'problem' system evolves to a maximally mixed state, so the final outcome is very close to a maximally mixed state -no change. $\mu$ is exponentially close to 0 - almost no change. 
This holds regardless of open or closed system. So no interesting dynamics can arise from quantum cooling.
There is not much we can do by cooling, and indeed this is the main lesson of the small corrections theorem in black hole physics.
If you believe that locally only small corrections are made, then accumulation of small corrections is only small.
You don't get to escape by arguing about us working within EFT unless you say EFT is actually not unitary.
The small corrections-like theorems are about necessity of large corrections to EFT for black hole evaporation to work, and this point is often misunderstood.

As stated above, this applies generally to black holes as well.
Cooling is difficult, and it tends to move the system
