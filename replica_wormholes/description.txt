Writing this while a new paper is being drafted.

header:2. A generalization of ETH in chaotic CFTs
An eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) argument made more general in chaotic CFTs in https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05499 .
header:3. Question:
Does arXiv:2006.05499 prove that replica wormholes are valid non-perturbative contributions of a bulk theory?
header:4. Answer:
Well, it depends on what we mean.
As the Stanford slide shows, it is difficult to avoid the ensemble interpretation when incorporating replica wormholes.
The `ensemble interpretation' here is not exactly quantum foundation's ensemble interpretation, though very similar.
But if we take the bulk theory as an ensemble theory, then it means the realized bulk effective field theory (EFT) is actually being corrected.
This is fine, as long as we properly recognize its consequence.
header:5. Answer / notable consequences
The whole picture goes against the conventional semiclassical picture of the bulk EFT being valid around the horizon.
But we can be more precise about semiclassicality, and argue that the entanglement wedge duality around the semiclassical spacetime still holds.
Therefore, the semiclassical picture may continue to hold.
It is also possible that the bulk EFT remains valid for each classical outcome / geometry, but not for a superposition state.
(See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings .)
header:6. Key insight / main point
The Stanford slide also shows what I write here:
Even in arXiv:2006.05499, calculation is about $\langle Z\rangle$ here, ensemble average of some partition function of individual CFT (or SYK) instance.
This is different from $Z_{ensemble}$, partition function of an ensemble theory. $Z_{ensemble} \neq \langle Z \rangle$.
Notations need to be read carefully.
header:7. Simple insight:
Partially aligned with arXiv:2006.05499, consider some pure states that are indistinguishable by coarse-grained observables.
These pure states carry zero (von Neumann, or trivially in this case, entanglement) entropy.
However, since these states $\rho$ are different, ensemble state $\langle \rho\rangle$ is not going to be a pure state.
But it is $\langle \rho \rangle$ that is captured by the ensemble bulk theory (JT or some corresponding AdS gravity).
Therefore, is it 'fundamentally' surprising that replica wormholes correct entropy calculations in path integrals? Not really.
header:8. A major 'but':
To restate, the bulk black hole horizon will not behave according to the assumed bulk "ensemble" theory.
This is non-trivial, and we either need the entanglement wedge duality or something like the proposal I presented above to save the semiclassical picture.
header:9. Are replica wormholes unitary?
Partially yes, partially no.
Taken as non-perturbative contributions of bulk EFT, difficult to defend.
The standard unitary quantum mechanics understanding of the replica trick does not endorse a use of replica geometries.
Taken as fundamental corrections to EFT itself, unitarity may be defended.
header:10. What if we take replica wormholes to be genuine non-perturbative contributions of EFT?
Firewalls according to arXiv:2411.09548. There, firewalls are interpreted just as consequences, but..
Firewall dramas likely suggest that something is off.
Indeed, they are, because we are not supposed to think of replica wormholes as 'genuine' bulk ensemble theory contributions.

header:trivial memos that were previously here (currently a mess)
A) Schwarzian action equality for JT/SYK.
B) What Suvrat Raju suspected in "lessons from the information problem" is that what replica wormholes compute is coarse-grained entropy, not fine-grained.
(soon updating: going over calculations)
His argument does not reflect the fact that the JT theory here is an ensemble theory, so it makes less sense to compare apples with oranges.
However, the argument does show that replica wormholes are problematic if we do take the JT theory to be a true bulk theory, not just an ensemble theory.
C) (potentially moving to the main points, and also in arXiv:2006.05499) Indeed, we could say that the troubles with replica wormholes are visible in Hilbert space factorization, where we must consider parts of the black hole interior as corresponding to radiations.
D) Information problem is about fine-grained entropy, and:
$$\textbf{whether we can initially start from small corrections that can eventually accumulate to large corrections to reverse entanglement entropy increases}$$
which is what Prof. Samir Mathur has been trying to discuss in his small corrections theorem.
There will be large corrections, the question is whether we can start from small corrections and accumulate.
Why small corrections initially? Well, think about ordinary life. $\textbf{We don't have to consult quantum gravity to make good predictions}$.
We expect black holes to be similar initially.
After all, if quantum gravity breaks non-gravitational quantum superpositions by entanglement, then unless quantum mechanics is being modified, then non-gravitational quantum superpositions will be broken, and their effects will be known non-gravitationally.
In the past, we have had this idea of black hole complementarity, but the idea has largely been gone out of fashion. So I will not speak of it.
This is why we are talking of fine-grained entropy even if we seem to be discussing coarse-grained entropy in the small corrections theorem.
Because:
$$\textbf{it is really hard to break pure non-gravitational superpositions by quantum gravity effects without any effect on coarse-grained non-gravitational states.}$$
If we expect semiclassical no drama pictures to be maintained down to full evaporation, we should be able to discuss in terms of coarse-grained states and how they are corrected over time due to quantum gravity effects.
By the way, the "extended" small corrections theorem exactly goes over this issue - does the full fine-grained state change the theorem? The answer in the theorem was no, as long as the conventional semiclassical picture is assumed.
The debate should really be:
$$\textbf{is it possible in theory for an observer to collect all radiations and verify purity of radiations?}$$
If we can, then we can describe in terms of fine-grained corrections to coarse-grained states.
If we cannot, then the small corrections theorem does not even make sense.

But there is something new going on.. to be revealed soon.
