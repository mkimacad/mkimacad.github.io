header:History (date-wise)
A part of the below discussion submitted to Journal Quantum Information Processing (first submission round, mid-2024) - largely forgotten at this point.
The submission could have been better - I could have elaborated more on the "effective" nature of path integrals involved, along with more advanced discussions that appear here.

header:The non-unitarity puzzle of replica wormholes (simple thought experiment)
Continuing from https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld . Replica wormholes essentially argue that (since Euclidean space corrections amount to quantum state corrections):
$$|\Psi(0)\rangle = \sqrt{1-\epsilon_0}|\psi(0)\rangle + \sqrt{\epsilon_0}|rw(0)\rangle$$
$$|\psi(t_L)\rangle = \sqrt{1-\epsilon_L}|rw(t_L)\rangle + \sqrt{\epsilon_L}|\psi(t_L)\rangle$$
with $\epsilon_0,\epsilon_L \ll 1$, and $|\Psi\rangle$ is the full corrected state while $|\psi\rangle$ is the original EFT state without replica wormhole corrections.
This is by itself not problematic, but we know that the evolution of $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is approximately unitary. This is essentially the small corrections theorem re-casted, since the above evolution requires non-linearity.
What we mean by non-unitarity in black hole evaporation is not theoretical non-unitarity but rather physical non-unitarity - asymptotic observers at radial infinity never see the black hole interior, so we expect the exterior to be in a pure state after complete black hole evaporation.
So we have to sacrifice something: non-unitarity, non-linearity or non-locality. It is non-locality that is sacrificed. This requires EFT or quantum states to be modified.
But the logical appeal of replica wormholes is that this is just a gravitational path integral on sufficiently local EFT. And there is a way out: treat a theory derived from the path integral formalism as a nonlinear effective field theory.
And then, why not? Yes, quantum observables are linear observables, but the JCM model (https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings ) provides a toy but fundamental, linear and unitary model. So we can map out observables easily.
Note that the above issue is why replica wormholes are never considered in other contexts - they break either unitarity or linearity. Even if replica wormholes lead to new saddles in non-black hole contexts, they are considered invalid - though the circumstance may actually be more complicated. 
header:A potential problem with the neck construction in Antonini et al. (2025) ("An Apologia for islands")
Antonini et al. (2025) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04311 ) argues that we do not need an external reservoir (or KR branes, etc.) to reproduce islands via the neck construction - no massive graviton in other words.

You can define EFT on some manifold with an additional small neck using the path integral formalism. But would this be a linear unitary theory?
This is not proved. That we define some theory on the conformal boundary of asymptotically AdS does not guarantee that AdS/CFT can be invoked. Not all CFTs are holographic CFTs, which can be seen from the Terashima-Sugishita results, though they are far from being first to emphasize the point. ("Don't simply invoke holographic dictionaries, they do not always give you unitary - to - unitary theory mapping.") Is the bulk theory really unitary?
In fact, it is exactly this unitarity question that is being debated and is left unanswered. Islands? The factorization problem. Replica wormholes? Either non-unitarity or non-linearity. Implicitly, they all lead to the same question - is the bulk theory really unitary? If not, then its holographic CFT is also not unitary. The neck construction only removes the "external reservoir" part, but cannot address whether there are EFT transitions (one EFT to a series of new EFTs), quantum state corrections (that we can brush aside by adopting by non-linear "replica wormhole-corrected" EFT) or Hilbert space modifications or anything else while the Page curve is being reproduced.
Of course the whole picture may not be this bad, if we admit that non-linear (but unitary in sense of unit norm preservation) EFTs are relevant as long as their very approximate nature is properly understood. Then the neck construction is very important - we do not need additional structures to reproduce the Page curve in AdS/CFT, as long as we have appropriate asympotitcally AdS.
It is in this context that I write the below memos and the memo papers - the possibility of utilizing effective non-linearity for additional quantum computing powers. 
header:A potential non-linear quantum computing scheme based on non-linear effective field theory
Again, I do not think non-linear EFT is necessarily bad, as long as we have a way of mapping observables to true linear observables. With this context, I construct a potential quantum computer that takes advantage of effective non-linearity.

The above image models a wavepacket coming from left and right sides. Outside the left and right "tubes" and the main chamber, assume infinite potential $V=\infty$. More precisely,

where left and right tubes are modelled more accurately ("antennae") such that when wavepackets enter the main chamber, they intersect almost exactly at some location. This setup allows destructive interference to occur according to the path integral formalism - we have a non-linear EFT if unitarity is preserved.
There are different ways to recover the full theory, though these procedures all result in different complete theories.
The point to remember is that the normalized path integral formalism never predicts destructive cancellation. Rather we obtain some unit-norm state as the limit of preceding normalized states.
In a way, this is a nonlinear model of the double-slit experiment where photons can never escape detection by experiment apparatus. Basic interference lessons as well as particle-wave duality remain valid, even though linearity is lost. This is therefore also a model of the duality interference computer that does not rely on postselection but rather on non-linear EFT, grounded upon the path integral formalism.
With a simple construction, it is possible to detect the pre-normalization destructive interference pattern in this form of the duality computer, just as in black holes we can witness the effects of replica wormholes if they ever exist - see the evolution below.
$$\frac{\sqrt{1-\alpha}}{\sqrt 2}(|\psi_L(0)\rangle+|\psi_R(0)\rangle)+\sqrt{\alpha}|rw(0)\rangle \to |RW(T)\rangle$$
$$|\psi_L(T)\rangle = -|\psi_R(T)\rangle$$
Replace $|rw\rangle$ with the detection bit $|D\rangle$ that remains unaffected by destructive cancellation of $|\psi_L\rangle$ and $|\psi_R\rangle$ at $t=T$ according to the unnormalized path integral formalism.
In this fashion, we can hope for additional quantum computational powers - detecting the unnormalized destructive interference pattern means solving a search problem. We also get an additional angle on how classicality emerges - consider left and right tubes as reflecting the small-N regime where orthogonality are well-respected within EFT. As the wavepackets from the tubes approach the main chamber, they arrive at the large-N regime where orthogonality between different EFT states starts to break down. This does not mean orthogonality is actually lost - they are hidden beyond what EFT can see. In the full theory, linearity and unitarity continue to be respected. 
But at this point we have to make up our mind. This only works if nonlinear EFTs constructed by the path integral formalism are valid. And I also am unsure what I should get out of this. Is this simply a result of improper quantizations? Maybe.
