header:Ice-breaking but with hot coffee
See: https://mkimacad.github.io/coffee maybe?
From the above image, we know that latest image models (Sora, maybe?) are yet far from perfection.
The prompt was to generate a Hario switch dripper, with coffee being extracted. It did not understand that the dripper rib structure is essential to V60 and Hario switch. (It looks something like flat-bottom dripper Kalita Wave or Timemore B75..) Nevertheless, this is interesting, because the image resembles what a layman uninterested in drip (filter) coffee would have drawn. And the image otherwise is decent.
Many things have changed from 2020 - for better or for worse (especially in case of education).
Sometimes coffee brewing seems like the reverse of aerodynamics..
header:My interest
Quantum (computation) insights applied to black holes and sometimes philosophy. But my fascination is with black holes, and I believe holography still provides the best way to study them.
Currently heading toward theoretical (though all sorts of different areas) applications of the Jaynes-Cummings model, so this could be said to be the focal point as well.
header:On (journal) published papers.
These all partially involve black holes - see https://mkimacad.github.io/blackholes for the shared storylines behind the papers, analysis and notes. This github.io page should be the best starting point for understanding my perspectives toward quantum physics.
The papers involved:
https://mkimacad.github.io/philsci_time, https://mkimacad.github.io/quantum_thermal_search, https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld. Possibly on order of ascending importance.
header:Black hole singularities can be beneficial? (Journal Sophia)
$$\textbf{Can't black holes impose finite timelines for everyone?}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/philsci_time, I ask whether black hole singularities can be good things, allowing us to avoid inconvenient philosophical and logical issues by cutting down observer timelines to finite proper time. (Published in Journal Sophia)
header:Quantum thermal search (Journal Quantum Information Processing)
$$\textbf{Let's cool a quantum system to solve search problems but w/o varying } H\text{?}$$
$$\textbf{Adiabatic quantum computing is dead(?), but quantum cooling alive?}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/quantum_thermal_search, I ask whether quantum thermodynamics (mainly cooling) can be harnessed to provide exponential speedup for search problems. The answer is sort-of yes, sort-of no. If exponential precision to purity of some bath is considered demanding, the answer is no. If inability to write down exact interaction Hamiltonian is considered problematic, the answer is also no, and conventional qubit gate-based simulations are impossible without collapsing to quantum random walks. Our current understanding of black holes allows a convenient implementation of quantum thermal search based on black holes that avoids interactions having to be specified in terms of precise system descriptions - see https://mkimacad.github.io/blackholes .

header:On Karch-Randall braneworld (Journal Fortschritte der Physik - Progress of Physics)
$$\textbf{Bulk Hilbert space factorization, quo vadis?}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld, I investigate the Karch-Randall braneworld and controversies. Holography of information says that quantum gravity's observables are different from non-gravitational theory's observables, and black hole information is already on the black hole exterior. This view is not necessarily in conflict with the Karch-Randall braneworld view, manifest as the Hilbert space factorization problem in the Karch-Randall braneworld.
Basically the problem is that the bulk is shared by both the brane and the standard boundary, and the entanglement wedge of a boundary region can overlap with the brane. So bulk Hilbert space regional factorization-wise, there are information separation troubles, but this is not actually an issue, if we believe in holography of information. Nevertheless, holography of information alone ('Page curve unnecessary') does not resolve the black hole information problem, since it is possible that near-horizon behaviors can still be pathological, and this is what motivates many to replicate the Page curve.
And indeed, we could say that while the Page curve is rendered obsolete in a full quantum gravity (QG) theory, it is not in a non-gravitational theory with our familiar and usual local quantum observables. Holography is special, in sense that a QG theory has a dual non-gravitational understanding with a lower spacetime dimension, so we can explore the Page curve in a non-gravitational theory. This is analyzed within the conventional Karch-Randall braneworld setup and the toy Karch-Randall braneworld qudit model, which develops into another paper in https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings .

header:AdS/VAEBM - studying perturbations to AdS/CFT via deep learning? (Currently under Nuclear Physics B revision stage)
$$\textbf{Forget about AdS/CFT (no), holography just as bulk path integral!}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/ads_vaebm (Revision stage, Nuclear Physics B submission), I push the idea of holography with deep learning.
The paper builds on the AdS/DL proposal of Hashimoto (2019), but makes the functional form of admissible (theory) actions flexible by swapping DBM with the variational encoder-EBM structure. Essentially, Hashimoto (2019) is the holographic path integral implementation in terms of deep learning, and the DBM restriction is not a theoretical necessity. 
With deep learning, we can explore how far holography can work with perturbations of different 'boundaries'. In the paper, I explore how we may use deep learning to study perturbations to IR limits, while largely keeping the UV CFT. Bulk gravity reflects such perturbations in terms of encoded Euclidean action in a gravity theory. This is useful because the problem with holography currently is that we get wrong IR limits, along with wrong bulk spacetime (which includes AdS, but this is a subtle one).
In AdS/DL (AdS/DBM, AdS/VAEBM), while IR encodes and compresses information on UV, probabilistic independence can be noted such that some UV state can correspond to multiple IR states and vice versa, which provides a key in understanding observable and meausrment behaviors that become important in interpreting issues in quantum gravity.
header:The modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model of black holes
$$\textbf{What happened to empty black hole branches in a superposition?}$$
$$\textbf{My semiclassical spacetime should still be safe!}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings (First round submission stage), I continue on the toy qudit model of the black hole but now specifically instantiated in terms of the modified Jaynes-Cummings model. This allows us to explore more precisely and specifically where the small corrections theorem of Samir Mathur went wrong, along with the AMPS firewall argument.
There is nothing wrong with effective field theory (EFT), when restricted to non-empty black hole quantum branches. In a quantum superposition, there will be branches with an empty black hole, and these no longer generate entanglement. Conventionally, they were considered to be suppressed, but they build up eventually such that entanglement entropy decrease is inevitable. Despite this, semiclassical spacetime geometry remains valid due to the central limit theorem, and the black hole exterior sees nothing special. Infalling observers also see nothing special in the interior whenever the black hole is in each number-energy state $|n\rangle$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$ - $n=0$, and a non-black hole horizon vacuum is seen, for $n\gineq 0$, the black hole horizon vacuum is seen. But the two vacua are different, which leads to special effects when in a mixed superposition.
header:High-frequency filtering via imaginary-time deep learning
$$\textbf{Two DL time axes for signal processing of mathematical interests}$$
In https://mkimacad.github.io/imaginary_time_DL (First round submission stage), I explore how the use of imaginary time in deep learning can aid high-frequency filtering. In contrast to empirical signals, we can compute samples of different functions that allow for complex domain. This leads to significant computation and filtering performance differences in deep learning.
header:A set of credo/creed (very unserious, continuously updating)
I believe that we are already close to resolving the black hole information problem. (at least that's a good belief to have.)
I believe that qudit models (including JCM) reveal much about our universe. (no, but to some degree.)
I believe that holography is actually there in the universe, even though its role in resolving the information problem may have been overrated.
I believe that the logics behind quantization procedures need to be understood, in particular with respect to effective field theories.
I believe that the logics of equilibrium convergence need to be properly understood, regardless of areas and fields.
