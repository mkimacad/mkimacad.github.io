A) Encoding an NP-complete problem into a sum f(t) of cosine functions w/ period T: RMS therefore completely determined. LCU and amplitude amplification iterations bounded (not exponential).
The conventional graph traversal way of encoding f(t) will have problems - amplifying LCU will require exponential steps. So a different approach required.
Basically, the problem's reduced to checking whether the zero-frequency amplitude's zero or not.
Exact amplification's needed in this step - however, since we know exact unitary $U_f$ from $|0\rangle$ to $|\Psi_0\rangle \propto \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} f(t)|t\rangle$, this is not a problem. 
B-1) Whether $|\Psi_0\rangle \propto \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} f(t)|t\rangle$ can be filtered efficiently to zero frequency data even when there are exponentially many frequencies.
While not widely known, we already know that quantum signal processing's superior to classical signal processing.
No need to check exact amplitude of zero frequency - just need checking existence.
Idea: at the end, $|\omega=0\rangle$ measured after quantum Fourier transform -> zero frequency exists. Otherwise, not existing.
For that purpose, quantum signal processing's extremely efficient!
B-2) We don't need exact amplitude amplification. As long as we can boost the zero-frequency signal whenever it exists by some constant ratio, we're fine.
We only need exact amplification when constructing $|\Psi_0\rangle. The design of constructing fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification relies on quantum signal processing's polynomial construction.
Basically, we design a quantum filter directly within LCU/amplification steps.
B-3) When designing quantum filter, the reminder's that maximum attenuation ratio directly corresponds to success probability of each iteration. So need to assure that it's some non-zero constant.
