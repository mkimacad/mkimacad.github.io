header:An idea, revisited five years later
1. A philosophy of physics paper that also overlaps with philosophy of religion.
2. Argues that black hole singularities cut down any theoretical observer timelines such that observer-wise infinite time can be made impossible.
3. Different observer 'finite' timelines are mutually compatible within a quantum gravity theory, practically giving us an infinite timeline but not exactly.
4. Therefore, potential paradoxes relating to infinite time may not be the best way to formulate a necessity proof of God. 
5. But if the paradoxes relating to infinite time are genuine paradoxes, then black hole singularities may be blessings instead of curses.
6. Black hole singularities then do not just represent incompleteness of the classical picture. They may be fundamental necessities for logical consistency.
7. This makes us think of ideas like holography of information: instead of trying to complete the picture of the black hole interior separately, consider reconstructions instead.
8. Focusing theorems are not properly discussed here, but they are beneficial for the purpose here.
9. Early paper, could have been written much better now.
10. **Unfortunately important as well: This is not an atheist argument. I am a theist myself, though bound by scientific justifications.**
