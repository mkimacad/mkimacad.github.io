header:I do believe in quantum gravity, but a general issue with attempts to demonstrate the necessity of quantum gravity
In general, attempts to demonstrate the necessity of gravity quantization resort to quantum measurement results.
If we accept the standard postulates of quantum mechanics on measurements - linearity and Born rule, then these results largely follow.
Some "people" take the Born rule only as an approximation to the underlying reality, and even the stochastic nature ("measurement problem").
In particular, reliance on measurements means collapse mechanisms or their non-existence matters.
header:Main goal
A thought experiment for quantization of gravity without reliance on measurements or wavefunction collapse.
Instead rely on (non-)unitarity and entanglement of the black hole exterior.
At the end of evaporation, if we have significant entanglement entropy (even to the point of monotonic increase) on a black hole assuming semiclassical gravity, then we have a problem, unless we believe in remnants or entangled world.
Note that the lesson in https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings is: even though this thought experiment for quantization of gravity holds, approximate semiclassicality nevertheless continues to hold.
header:Assumptions required
The conclusion of the thought experiment - that gravity needs to be quantized - depends on:
1) The validity of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy up to very small corrections in providing the entropy upper bound to a black hole. Smaller black hole, smaller upper bound to its entanglement entropy. This means that at the end of evaporation, unitarity solely on the black hole exterior has to be restored.
2) The largely deprecated version of black hole complementarity - that exterior observers never actually observe violations of unitarity and energy conservation despite existence of actual violations - is not there.
3) The assumption of linearity, at least within black hole physics EFT. Within a quantum superposition, a local outcome state within the superposition can be considered. If spacetime is assumed the same across all local outcomes ("same gravitational field"), then each local outcome state can be examined independently of other outcomes with the same semiclassical EFT on the fixed background spacetime and then added back linearly as a superposition. 
4) Something like remnants or observable singularities do not form at the end of evaporation,
If all are valid, then 'the empty black hole branch on some non-empty black hole spacetime' leads to the eventual energy non-conservation. When measured as in the conventional postulates of quantum mechanics, this is a serious trouble. However, even without measurements we see that it is inconsistent with Bekenstein-Hawking.
If 1) is invalid, then unitarity of the black hole exterior may not be there. Intuitively, an empty black hole entangled with the exterior seems troubling, especially given that no reasonable physics descriptions exist for describing an empty black hole. This often leads to the idea of remnants or some singularities proposals. 
If 2) is invalid, then the goal is to find why observers cannot detect contradictions. This moves us back to the times around 2013, when people were scrambling to save observation-dependent black hole complementarity, especially using quantum information and computation theories.
If 3) is invalid, then a lot of soul searching would be needed. We do not know what this even means. From the small corrections theorem, we know that small corrections to EFT alone will not save the day. So unless violations from linearity are severe and observable, Bekenstein-Hawking would need to break down.
If 4) is invalid, then the consequence may be mild, but we do not understand remnants and singularities well.
header:Different meaning as to semiclassical gravity
In mainstream black hole physics, gravity is not fundamentally semiclassical in any form. Nevertheless, for the purpose of evaporation, semiclassical EFT (with semiclassicality referring to Møller-Rosenfeld, where gravity responds to expected stress-energy tensor) is understood to provide reasonable estimates, upon which small corrections are added to restore unitarity of the black hole exterior. This has been challenged around year 2009-2012, and the current mainstream responses largely evolve around holography of information and replica wormholes, which have all been somewhat controversial.
Within the literature that discusses the (non-)necessity of gravity quantization, what we mean by semiclassical gravity can differ as well. As discussed in Tilloy's quasi-review paper (see below), we have the conventional Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, where the stress-energy tensor of the Einstein field equations comes from the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor operator, but there are other approaches as well. 
header:Feynman-Bohr-Rosenfeld (FBR) and Eppley-Hannah arguments for quantization of gravity and Kent's counter-argument
Use a quantum particle in superposition (double-slit fashion, charged or massive particles). Measure some classical field ("electromagnetic field" or "gravitational field") to reveal which path it went through. According to FBR, this collapses the superposition without measuring the quantum system, implying non-unitary (or non-linear) evolution of the quantum system. Or, as Eppley-Hannah further elaborates, we have three scenarios, starting with the initial quantum system in momentum eigenstate $|p\rangle$, with potential position detection going through small-momentum small-wavelength classical graviational waves:
1) Gravitational waves collapse the initial quantum state, resulting in violation of the uncertainty principle but energy conserved for each outcome (the momentum of the quantum system remains close to $p$, since gravitational waves are close to zero momentum).
2) Graviational waves collapse the initial quantum state in a way consistent with the uncertainty principle, but energy cannot then be conserved. $|k\rangle$ suddenly changes to a position-like state of high momentum variance. But see Oppenheim's evasion attempt - this is problematic only because we assume that the classical system has to react deterministically, and the whole collapse is deterministic in nature. 
3) Gravitational waves alone do not collapse the initial quantum state. But suppose we have two entangled particles $L,R$ that are spatially distant, with particle $L$ then collapsed with a quantum measurement while $R$ remaining uncollapsed. Then superluminal signaling is possible, in case gravitational waves respond to the change in $L$. This is because observers close to $R$ can continuously monitor graviational waves without disturbing $R$. (If we continuously measure $R$ instead, there necessarily is disturbance to $L$ as well due to entanglement, defeating the purpose of signal detections.)
Kent (2018) (http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08708 ) argues the third scenario does not always hold. Suppose the following initial quantum state for $L,R$ (with distance $d$):
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|0_L,0_R\rangle+|1_L,1_R\rangle)$$
Now $L$ is measured at $t=T$, and suppose we have $|0_L\rangle$. While Hannah-Eppley assumes that the state of $R$ immediately changes to $|0_R\rangle$ or gravitational field responds to the change in $L$ immdediately, this may not be the case depending on the form of a hybrid theory. In particular, it is perfectly reasonable to assume a theory where the state of $R$ remains in mixed state $\frac{1}{2}(|0_R\rangle\langle 0_R|+|1_R\rangle\langle 1_R|)$ from $t=T$ to $t=T+d/c$. At $t=T+d/c$, a signal with speed of light can reach $R$ from $L$ that reflects the change in $L$ and $R$ changes to state $|0_R\rangle$. Therefore, the Eppley-Hannah argument loses its power in case classical gravitational waves do not collapse quantum states.
header:Page-Geilker argument and Großardt counter-argument (briefly discussed)
Paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.979 (only the publisher paywall version available)
A thought experiment that attempts to rule out the Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity. Does not rule out other forms of semiclassical gravity. But even for the Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity based on stress-energy tensor expectation, in case an additional collapse mechanism is given, then the Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity is not completely ruled out.
Then comes the Großardt counter-argument (http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10452 ).

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008068 
An attempt is to made to mix a fundamentally classical system (classical harmonic oscillator) and a quantum system (quantum harmonic oscillator) with some interaction (bilinear coupling) in a single quantum formalism, but the correspondence principle (or conservation of energy) then breaks down.
Basically we start from the Koopman-von Neumann classical mechanics formalism, where we cast Liouville (probability) density $f$ into a Hilbert space, which with $\psi(x,y,t) = \sqrt{f}$ gives us familiar Schrodinger equation, though with Hamiltonian $H$ replaced with the Liouville operator $L_v$ (not Lagrangian). This Liouvillian is in general treated unobservable, so its unbounded spectrum is considered a non-issue.
$$L_v = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial y}\right)\left(-i\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)-\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial x}\right)\left(-i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$$
$$i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=L_v\psi(x,y,t)$$
where $y$ now refers to classical momentum that is different from unobservable quantum momentum operator $\hat{p}_x = -id/dx$, since this is a fundamentally classical system. $L_v$ is also unobservable.
Then a quantum system is introduced in addition to the aforementioned classical system. The formalism is now modified but largely in spirit of the initial formalism to incorporate two systems: just with Liouvillian $L_v$ replaced with Koopmanian $K$ in the Schrodinger equation.
$$K = L_v(x,y,p_x,p_y)+H(q,p)+K_I$$
$$i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=K\psi(x,y,q,p,t)$$
where $q$ refers to position of the quantum system, $p$ refers to the momentum of the quantum system, $K_I$ refers to the interaction term to be determined and $H(q,p)$ is the free Hamiltonian of the quantum system. 
But classical interaction intuitions do not work, and the best possible is to treat bilinear interaction $kqx$ as a part of the classical system Hamiltonian which then forms corrected Liouvillian $L_v$. With this $L_v$, one obtains the expected classical equations of motion for coupling of two harmonic oscillators but with additional equations, which cause conservation of energy to break down.
header:Oppenheim's attempt to evade: postquantum theory
Relevant paper: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041040
A somewhat "old" intuition: instead of having deterministic interaction structures, only measurements being probabilistic, what if classical-quantum interactions are classically stochastic, and interaction laws only describe the probability by which some interaction is carried out? Linearity and unitarity can be preserved this way. This is neither the GR side of quantum gravity nor quantum gravity as a quantum theory.
We know that measurements lead to energy non-conservation in an individual quantum history. (See Sean Carroll's energy non-conservation paper, in case this is not already clear and trivial: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11052 ) What would be "wrong" in lifting this feature of quantum uncertainty to classical uncertainty? If we do not collapse into individual classical outcomes, then there is no energy conservation issue on average. So is conservation of energy and information really a necessary condition, as long as it holds on average? In a purely quantum theory, it is necessary that an energy (Hamiltonian) eigenstate evolves to the same energy eigenstate. But in this hybrid theory, this becomes a largely trivial notion, since we have a fundamentally classical system, and we can simply require the average energy of the full system to be preserved instead.
Furthermore, in such a hybrid theory, genuinely stochastic interactions create different histories for the classical system as well - the classical system is a fundamentally (and classically) stochastic system. The entire stochastic universe is unitary, but each classical history is not, and therefore a black hole exterior may remain in a mixed state even after complete black hole evaporation in each gravitational field history - non-conservation of information and energy. The author himself admits this - see http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12221 , especially the brief information problem part. Rest of the details are largely purely mathematical and slightly complex, so I do not replicate them here.
header:Potential problems with the postquantum theory
(See the argument in the end as well.)
The postquantum theory as a hybrid quantum-classical theory will allow for instances where an empty black hole (quantum-wise) is in non-empty black hole spacetime (classical gravitational field). Linearity enforces that these instances must be considered genuinely and individually. We believe that a conventional EFT on the given spacetime (gravitational field) continues to hold.
Then since unitarity is still enforced for evolution from the particular classical branch, and the black hole has no energy to emit, there should be no radiation. However, EFT on non-empty black hole spacetime demands that radiations should be emitted, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need the postquantum theory to explicitly rule out these instances, and I personally cannot see how this would avoid imposing conservation of energy for each classical-quantum interaction history.
Given this problem, I can instead off an account of a hybrid classical-quantum formalism, where classical systems are portrayed instead as a collection of $n$ identical systems, with $n \to \infty$. Or we can think of some quantum subsystem as collapsing into the ground state of time-varying subsystem Hamiltonian that interacts with some environment, with ground state evolution respecting classical equations of motion, rendering it classical. Neither of the ideas has been received favorably by the physics community, which I can understand, given the same and new problems stated above and I moved on. And we can agree to disagree. This is a difficult thing to do, and you can see why from this discussion.
For other critiques of postquantum theory, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037 and more importantly, https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07723v2 . See also Tilloy's non-relativistic toy model paper that utilizes a similar intuition (to postquantum theory): http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01823 , though the model features continuous measurements systemically included as a theory. 
header:Remnants, fuzzballs and final state proposal (brief discussions)
Some have argued that remnants remain as valid physics - see https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00322v2 for the review.
For fuzzballs, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05295 for the review, though as I argue, the small corrections theorem cannot be invoked to disprove the conventional semiclassical story. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10616 for a critique of the fuzzball proposal, its conclusion being that fuzzballs are too different from conventional black holes to be relevant.
For the final state proposal, see http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0310281 , though very few continue to advocate this view.
header:My argument
See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings . The same argument. If we replace the $U$ in the simplified model such that:
$$U|0,0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|0,0\rangle + |1,-1\rangle)$$
as part of general $U$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$
$$U|0,n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|0,n\rangle + |1,n-1\rangle)$$
until a black hole "semiclassically" evaporates completely, then the black hole entanglement entropy monotonically increases over time: late-time violations of Bekenstein-Hawking - a version of the usual black hole information problem as a consequence of fundamentally semiclassical gravity.
This invokes the idea that the black hole horizon vacuum (temperature increases as black holes become smaller) is significantlly different from the flat-space horizon vacuum according to EFT itself.
No measurement involved. Does not invoke conservation of energy.
