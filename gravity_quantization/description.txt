header:I do believe in quantum gravity, but a general issue with attempts to demonstrate the necessity of quantum gravity
In general, attempts to demonstrate the necessity of gravity quantization resort to quantum measurement results.
If we accept the standard postulates of quantum mechanics on measurements - linearity and Born rule, then these results largely follow.
Some "people" take the Born rule only as an approximation to the underlying reality, and even the stochastic nature ("measurement problem").

Use a quantum particle in superposition (double-slit fashion) to measure some classical field ("electromagnetic field" or "gravitational field").
