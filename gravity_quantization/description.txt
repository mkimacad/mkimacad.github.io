header:I do believe in quantum gravity, but a general issue with attempts to demonstrate the necessity of quantum gravity
In general, attempts to demonstrate the necessity of gravity quantization resort to quantum measurement results.
If we accept the standard postulates of quantum mechanics on measurements - linearity and Born rule, then these results largely follow.
Some "people" take the Born rule only as an approximation to the underlying reality, and even the stochastic nature ("measurement problem").
In particular, reliance on measurements means collapse mechanisms or their non-existence matters.
header:Main goal
A thought experiment for quantization of gravity without reliance on measurements.
Instead rely on (non-)unitarity and entanglement of the black hole exterior.
At the end of evaporation, if we have significant entanglement entropy (even to the point of monotonic increase) on a black hole assuming semiclassical gravity, then we have a problem, unless we believe in remnants or entangled world.
Bekenstein-Hawking - entropy upper bound on a black hole (up to very small corrections). Small black hole, smaller entanglement entropy upper bound.

header:Different meaning as to semiclassical gravity
In mainstream black hole physics, gravity is not fundamentally semiclassical. Nevertheless, for the purpose of evaporation, semiclassical EFT is understood to provide reasonable estimates, upon which small corrections are added to restore unitarity of the black hole exterior.

Use a quantum particle in superposition (double-slit fashion) to measure some classical field ("electromagnetic field" or "gravitational field").
