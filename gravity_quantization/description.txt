header:I do believe in quantum gravity, but a general issue with attempts to demonstrate the necessity of quantum gravity
In general, attempts to demonstrate the necessity of gravity quantization resort to quantum measurement results.
If we accept the standard postulates of quantum mechanics on measurements - linearity and Born rule, then these results largely follow.
Some "people" take the Born rule only as an approximation to the underlying reality, and even the stochastic nature ("measurement problem").
In particular, reliance on measurements means collapse mechanisms or their non-existence matters.
header:Main goal
A thought experiment for quantization of gravity without reliance on measurements.
Instead rely on (non-)unitarity and entanglement of the black hole exterior.
At the end of evaporation, if we have significant entanglement entropy (even to the point of monotonic increase) on a black hole assuming semiclassical gravity, then we have a problem, unless we believe in remnants or entangled world.
Note that the lesson in https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings is: even though this thought experiment for quantization of gravity holds, approximate semiclassicality nevertheless continues to hold.
header:Assumptions required
The conclusion of the thought experiment - that gravity needs to be quantized - depends on:
1) The validity of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy up to very small corrections in providing the entropy upper bound to a black hole. Smaller black hole, smaller upper bound to its entanglement entropy. This means that at the end of evaporation, unitarity solely on the black hole exterior has to be restored.
2) The largely deprecated version of black hole complementarity - that exterior observers never actually observe violations of unitarity and energy conservation despite existence of actual violations - is not there.
3) The assumption of linearity, at least within black hole physics EFT. Within a quantum superposition, a local outcome state within the superposition can be considered. If spacetime is assumed the same across all local outcomes ("same gravitational field"), then each local outcome state can be examined independently of other outcomes with the same semiclassical EFT on the fixed background spacetime and then added back linearly as a superposition. 
4) Something like remnants or observable singularities do not form at the end of evaporation,
If all are valid, then 'the empty black hole branch on some non-empty black hole spacetime' leads to the eventual energy non-conservation. When measured as in the conventional postulates of quantum mechanics, this is a serious trouble. However, even without measurements we see that it is inconsistent with Bekenstein-Hawking.
If 1) is invalid, then unitarity of the black hole exterior may not be there. Intuitively, an empty black hole entangled with the exterior seems troubling, especially given that no reasonable physics descriptions exist for describing an empty black hole. This often leads to the idea of remnants or some singularities proposals. 
If 2) is invalid, then the goal is to find why observers cannot detect contradictions. This moves us back to the times around 2013, when people were scrambling to save observation-dependent black hole complementarity, especially using quantum information and computation theories.
If 3) is invalid, then a lot of soul searching would be needed. We do not know what this even means. From the small corrections theorem, we know that small corrections to EFT alone will not save the day. So unless violations from linearity are severe and observable, Bekenstein-Hawking would need to break down.
If 4) is invalid, then the consequence may be mild, but we do not understand remnants and singularities well.
header:Different meaning as to semiclassical gravity
In mainstream black hole physics, gravity is not fundamentally semiclassical. Nevertheless, for the purpose of evaporation, semiclassical EFT is understood to provide reasonable estimates, upon which small corrections are added to restore unitarity of the black hole exterior. This has been challenged around year 2009-2012, and the current mainstream responses largely evolve around holography of information and replica wormholes, which have all been somewhat controversial.

An attempt is to made to mix a fundamentally classical system (classical harmonic oscillator) and a quantum system (quantum harmonic oscillator) with some interaction (bilinear coupling) in a single quantum formalism, but the correspondence principle (or conservation of energy) then breaks down.
Basically we start from the Koopman-von Neumann classical mechanics formalism, where we cast Liouville (probability) density $f$ into a Hilbert space, which with $\psi(x,y,t) = \sqrt{f}$ gives us familiar Schrodinger equation, though with Hamiltonian $H$ replaced with the Liouville operator $L_v$ (not Lagrangian). This Liouvillian is in general treated unobservable, so its unbounded spectrum is considered a non-issue.
$$L_v = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial y}\right)\left(-i\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)-\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial x}\right)\left(-i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$$
$$i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=L_v\psi(x,y,t)$$
where $y$ now refers to classical momentum that is different from unobservable quantum momentum operator $\hat{p}_x = -id/dx$, since this is a fundamentally classical system. $L_v$ is also unobservable.
Then a quantum system is introduced in addition to the aforementioned classical system. The formalism is now modified but largely in spirit of the initial formalism to incorporate two systems: just with Liouvillian $L$ replaced with Koopmanian $K$ in the Schrodinger equation.
$$K = L(x,y,p_x,p_y)+H(q,p)+K_I$$
$$i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=K\psi(x,y,q,p,t)$$
where $q$ refers to position of the quantum system, $p$ refers to the momentum of the quantum system, $K_I$ refers to the interaction term to be determined and $H(q,p)$ is the free Hamiltonian of the quantum system. 
But classical interaction intuitions do not work, and the best possible is to treat bilinear interaction $kqx$ as a part of the classical system Hamiltonian which then forms corrected Liouvillian $L$. With this $L$, one obtains the expected classical equations of motion for coupling of two harmonic oscillators but with additional equations, which cause conservation of energy to break down.
See Oppenheim's attempt though.

Noting this paper, since it gets mentioned a lot recently. Let me just agree to disagree and move on, maybe. But possibly covering it as well.

header:My argument
See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings . The same argument. If we replace the $U$ in the simplified model such that:
$$U|0,0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|0,0\rangle + |1,-1\rangle)$$
as part of general $U$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$
$$U|0,n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|0,n\rangle + |1,n-1\rangle)$$
until a black hole "semiclassically" evaporates completely, then the black hole entanglement entropy monotonically increases over time: late-time violations of Bekenstein-Hawking - a version of the usual black hole information problem as a consequence of fundamentally semiclassical gravity.
This invokes the idea that the black hole horizon vacuum (temperature increases as black holes become smaller) is significantlly different from the flat-space horizon vacuum according to EFT itself.
No measurement involved. Does not invoke conservation of energy.
