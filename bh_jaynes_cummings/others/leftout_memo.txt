header:Some trivial matters (3): On M'~N behaviors on the entropy curve. (Not in the paper, likely to be removed here as well since unnecessary)
Let M' be the number of outgoing qubits (and will no longer interact). In the entropy curve, for M'~N, the distribution of excited states in the black hole settles something similar to Gaussian distributions such that we can treat entropy increase to be approximately constant. [variance M'/4, total energy variance lower..]
