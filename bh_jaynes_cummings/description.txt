header:On simulation code (baseline: codes/jaynes_improved.py)
Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of atoms), N (number of photons), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.
header:Some trivial matters (1): Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice, some terminology equivalence
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.

header:Some trivial matters (2): On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Since this is a toy qudit model, time is modelled as the number of qubits that interacted with the black hole. This can be re-scaled to fit the Page curve and so the slope of the entropy curve should not be of concern here. It can also be noted that initial entropy increase can be slowed down (such that increases are almost constant across initially interacting qubits) by tuning down the interaction time of each qubit, which is available in the baseline code by reduc parameter.
header:Do we need to replicate the Page curve, given holography of information?
See discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld, but some of them are replicated here. To be updated.
header:Large-M,Large-N,small interaction time behavior
To be updated, this is the most important part to understand about the black hole horizon.
header:Where the small corrections theorem and the AMPS firewall subadditivity paradox got wrong - or the imprecise meaning of "semiclassical no-drama horizon"
Updates coming up.
header:Effective dimension of the black hole Hilbert space, as relating to the small corrections theorem
The small corrections theorem assumes that the effective black hole Hilbert space dimension can increase over time. However, can we really assume so? We can argue that the point of the small corrections theorem is to say that our usual semiclassical picture requires such increases, and the contents of this paper clarify why we can still have some form of semiclassicality and yet effective dimension must decrease over time.
