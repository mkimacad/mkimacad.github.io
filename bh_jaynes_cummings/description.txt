Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of radiation qubits), N (number of particles in the black hole), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.

header:The main goal of this paper
1) Show that semiclassical spacetime geometry can be consistent with the Page curve,
2) the problem with the small corrections theorem + firewall paradox has to do with empty black hole quantum branches in superpositions.
It is easy to achieve unitarity by violating semiclassical spacetime. Satisfying both goals is what makes the matter difficult. The paper succeeds.
(No-hair, no electricity, no angular momentum -> semiclassical geometry = semiclassical black hole mass (equivalently, energy).)
In this Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model, black hole=(optical) cavity=field, (Hawking) radiations=atom=qubits. $\hslash=1$ is used for convenience.
header:On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Qubits are not fundamental - they are only entropy/entanglement generators. Time can conveniently be re-scaled to fit the Page curve slopes.
header:General storylines
1. Non-interaction energy is conserved. Qubits are initialized with no energy to transfer to the black hole. The black hole probabilistically emits energy via JCM interaction until it reaches its ground state, thereby being purified - unitarity upheld even after complete evaporation.
2. Meanwhile, with small interaction time, semiclassical spacetime geometry with close to zero variance (via central limit theorem + very low variance of each qubit) can be maintained - semiclassical spacetime preserved.
3. This qudit model is almost identical to the toy qubit setup used in black hole physics.
4. The real issue with the black hole information problem is that semiclassical spacetime is often thought to imply that the empty black hole quantum branch of superpositions can be ignored. But contributions of this branch eventually build up, despite semiclassical spacetime. Without the energy lower bound of the black hole, black hole entanglement entropy builds up continuously even in this model.
5. Nothing wrong with EFT: complete evaporation or not, different horizon vacua. The black hole exterior sees nothing strange (horizon vacuum maintained).
6. AMPS firewall and the small corrections theorem went astray because infalling observers do not see the interior horizon vacuum, though they sort of do for each classically measured state $|n\rangle$.
header:JCM interaction setup
1. The JCM interaction (between one qubit and the black hole) of the model says: if a two-energy radiation qubit is in ground state $|0\rangle$ and the black hole has enegy, then the qubit should gain energy to the excited state. If the qubit is in excited state $|1\rangle$ then the black hole should gain energy. Our initial qubit state is always in $|0\rangle$, so the black hole always loses energy until complete evaporation. Governed by $H_I$.
2. Each $k$th qubit, initially in $|0\rangle$ interacts sequentially with the black hole for duration of $\Delta t_k$ ("interaction time"). Then the qubit flies away, never interacting with the black hole again.
3. The initial state of the black hole at $t=0$ is $|N\rangle$, with $a^{\dagger}a|N\rangle = N|N\rangle$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. The pre-interaction state of a qubit is $|0\rangle$ as aforementioned.
$$H_{rad} = \omega_a |1\rangle\langle 1|$$
$$H_{BH} = \omega_a a^{\dagger}a$$
with $[a,a^{\dagger}]=1$ and $[a,a]=[a^{\dagger},a^{\dagger}]=0$. 
$$H_I = g(|1\rangle\langle 0|a + |0\rangle \langle 1|a^{\dagger})$$
$g$ and $\omega_a$ are largely irrelevant in this paper.
header:Models/cases considered
Variable interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $\langle n \rangle$, the average excitation number of the black hole.
Fixed interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $N$, the initial particle number of the black hole.
Interaction time reduction: $\Delta t_k$ can be reduced by $k_r$ (reduc in the codes) to better induce semiclassicality of spacetime.
Simplified model: Replacing JCM interaction with a more simplified interaction unitary $U$ - for all $|n\rangle$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}$) of the black hole, same entanglement behavior except for $n=0$ (no entanglement).

header:On necessity of quantum gravity (possibly in v2 of the paper, or a separate paper)
The JCM model of this paper could be thought of as a thought experiment in the necessity of quantum gravity. Suppose gravity is fundamentally semiclassical or even classical. Then even for the empty black hole branch of a quantum superposition, an EFT on fixed curved spacetime (of some unknown gravity theory) will continue to work, and we have continuous entropy increases and energy outflow even fom the empty black hole branch. This can only realistically be defensible in terms of the largely deprecated version of black hole complementarity - that exterior observers never see this violation of energy conservation. It makes most sense to say that gravity needs to be quantized.
This conclusion depends on:
1) validity of examining individual outcomes in a quantum superposition state of some full gravity theory (not necessarily quantum gravity here, since we are dealing with the question of whether gravity needs to be quantized),
2) whether something like remnants will not form at the end of evaporation,
3) EFT on curved spacetime remains approximately valid for the given curved spacetime.
If all are valid, then 'the empty black hole branch on some non-empty black hole spacetime' leads to energy non-conservation.
If 1) is invalid, then 'the empty black hole branch' cannot be discussed.
If 2) is invalid, then there is no truly empty black hole branch.
If 3) is invalid (for example, fuzzballs), then there is no point in this paper anyway.  
header:Is this a consequence of no hair? (possibly in v2 of the paper)
Yes. If we had degenerate (ie. multiple) ground states, then entanglement entropy could be much larger at late times. So apparently, no hair actually helps us to solve the information problem. (Analyzing the case of degenerate ground states is also a wonderful future topic.)
header:On applications of CLT and large-m, small-n (possibly in v2 of the paper)
A potential counter-argument: you say that for an individual slice of some time duration with a large number of interacting qubits embedded, CLT operates such that the total energy emitted is semiclassical and variance becomes close to zero. But since you effectively lowered coupling constant, the entire duration of black hole evaporation will take much more time, approximately by the factor of $k_r^2$. So doesn't total variance from the semiclassical prediction of the total energy emitted eventually build up to a large value?
Response: Sort of yes, sort of no (see the third point). But:
1) Consider the time when the empty black hole branch becomes difficult to ignore. By then, so many qubits have been radiated away such that the semiclassical exterior horizon is there due to CLT. The surprise comes from the fact that despite this, the empty black hole branch starts to affect entropy and energy emission calculations ('entanglement entropy turnaround'), which really is of no surprise at all.
2) Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y)+2Cov(X,Y), and down to very late times, covariance part can be ignored since the entanglement structure does not change much from one interval to another.
3) $(k_r)^2(1/k_r)^2 = 1$, but by the time this '1' is reached, total energy emitted is already large relative to variance. And even though we may have same variance at the end time for the total energy emitted, the intermediate emission pictures can invoke CLT such that the entire process can be portrayed as practically classical just with the empty black hole branch corrections - see below. 
4) Most importantly, the actual point is that individual slice features essentially a normal deviation from the semiclassical prediction (having corrected for the zero black hole branch) down to very late times. By semiclassicality, it is meant that we can picture evaporation reflected on classical spacetime based on the semiclassical average evaporation prediction, possibly with some stochastic variance that is relatively unaffected by the exact microstate configuration of a black hole. That this remains true by adding up each time slice is the point of this paper. You just need to correct each time slice by the empty black hole branch corrections.
header:The JCM model 'models' absorption as well (not in the paper, nor needed, but possibly in v2)
If a qubit is initialized in $|1\rangle$, then we have the black hole absorbing energy on average instead (the black hole attracts matter-energy), later releasing it back once other qubits are mostly on $|0\rangle$.
header:Effects of large energy outflow on semiclassicality (possibly in v2 of the paper)
In a way, small energy left on the black hole already implies a limited number of microstates on the black hole, which implies entanglement entropy decrease. So semiclassicality on early times guarantees entropy decrease on later times.
header:On temperature-based re-scaling of interaction time and abrupt vacuum change (possibly in v2 of the paper)
While this paper scales interaction time quasi-uniformly, we can adjust interaction time such that it varies with the semiclassical temperature of the black hole. As the black hole becomes smaller, temperature increases, which leads to an abrupt vacuum change right before or after complete evaporation, unless we believe in final remnants. Therefore, a potential counter-argument that the abrupt 'vacuum change' does not arise cannot hold. There is no smooth tranisition to the approximately flat-space horizon. This is a well-understood and established point, so should not be controversial, and indeed the necessity of this abrupt change without remnants has inspired some to accept remnants instead.
header:Extra talks: replica wormholes (not in the paper)
There could also be workarounds that minimize the partial breakdown of semiclassicality. Essentially, the issue is that the black hole does not exist for some quantum branches, so these branches need to be taken out to the exterior, if we are following the traditional qubit pair picture. This may be achieved by the ideas like replica wormholes - see discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , though note that in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 , Khodahami and Azizi (2024) argues that firewalls can be generated with replica wormholes. If this holds generally, the interior horizon vacuum is not really saved.
header:Some trivial matters: Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.
header:Do we need to replicate the Page curve, given holography of information?
See discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , but some of them are replicated here. In short, confirmation by our familiar local non-gravitational horizon observables is important. Holography of information can be or is correct, but there may still be pathologies around black hole horizons that require understanding. We cannot simply invoke unitarity of quantum physics or AdS/CFT to resolve the information problem, and this is essentially the same thing.
header:Is black hole complementarity or a special 'boundary of a boundary' setup like Karch-Randall braneworld necessary?
No. But they provide convenient ways of directly connecting to quantum gravity calculations.
header:Digression: "remnants" of incomplete fragments that may become relevant
(Also quantization issues, if we do not properly correct states. Complications after complications. It does not seem like these complications are just for black hole setups.)
(And the JCM model of this paper also makes us the very condition of classicality within large-n classicality, but I will stop here for now.)
