header:On simulation code (baseline: codes/jaynes_improved.py)
Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of radiation qubits), N (number of particles in the black hole), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.

header:JT gravity-inspired theory of measurements?

AND Really trivia (new - February 11, 2026) but.
Also copied to the measurement page.
So instead of the Jaynes-Cummings model to talk about maintaining EFT throughout evaporation,
we can instead consider JT gravity black hole coupled to M reservoirs initially at zero temperature, sequentially interacting.
Because JT black holes have positive specific heat, and we use fresh reservoirs repeatedly, a JT black hole will cool to zero temperature.
However, this toy model has no mean of showing where the conventional (monotonic) entanglement (increase) problem arises.
Furthermore, it is definitely inapplicable to Schwarzschild black hole cases.
(Side note: we have to distinguish maximal mixing that does not respect conservaion of non-interaction energy with maximal mixing that respects conservation.)

header:History (date-wise)
Paper V1/github.io description: May 25-31, 2025
A memo on the necessity of gravity quantization, forked to https://mkimacad.github.io/gravity_quantization: May 31-June 2, 2025
Significantly revised the github.io description, correcting an initially misleading explanation: June 3, 2025 
header:The main goal of this paper
1) Show that semiclassical spacetime geometry can be consistent with the Page curve,
2) the problem with the small corrections theorem + firewall paradox has to do with empty black hole quantum branches in superpositions.
It is easy to achieve unitarity by violating semiclassical spacetime. Satisfying both goals is what makes the matter difficult. The paper succeeds.
(No-hair, no electricity, no angular momentum -> semiclassical geometry = semiclassical black hole mass (equivalently, energy).)
In this Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model, black hole=(optical) cavity=field, (Hawking) radiations=atom=qubits. $\hslash=1$ is used for convenience.
header:On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Qubits are not fundamental - they are only entropy/entanglement generators. Time can conveniently be re-scaled to fit the Page curve slopes.
header:General storylines
1. Non-interaction energy is conserved. Qubits are initialized with no energy to transfer to the black hole. The black hole probabilistically emits energy via JCM interaction until it reaches its ground state, thereby being purified - unitarity upheld even after complete evaporation.
2. Meanwhile, with small interaction time, semiclassical spacetime geometry with close to zero variance (via central limit theorem + very low variance of each qubit) can be maintained - semiclassical spacetime preserved.
3. This qudit model is almost identical to the toy qubit setup used in black hole physics.
4. The real issue with the black hole information problem is that semiclassical spacetime is often thought to imply that the empty black hole quantum branch of superpositions can be ignored. But contributions of this branch eventually build up, despite semiclassical spacetime. Without the energy lower bound of the black hole, black hole entanglement entropy builds up continuously even in this model.
5. Nothing wrong with EFT: complete evaporation or not, different horizon vacua. The black hole exterior sees nothing strange (horizon vacuum maintained).
6. AMPS firewall and the small corrections theorem went astray because infalling observers do not see the interior horizon vacuum, though they sort of do for each classically measured state $|n\rangle$.
header:JCM interaction setup
1. The JCM interaction (between one qubit and the black hole) of the model says: if a two-energy radiation qubit is in ground state $|0\rangle$ and the black hole has enegy, then the qubit should gain energy to the excited state. If the qubit is in excited state $|1\rangle$ then the black hole should gain energy. Our initial qubit state is always in $|0\rangle$, so the black hole always loses energy until complete evaporation. Governed by $H_I$.
2. Each $k$th qubit, initially in $|0\rangle$ interacts sequentially with the black hole for duration of $\Delta t_k$ ("interaction time"). Then the qubit flies away, never interacting with the black hole again.
3. The initial state of the black hole at $t=0$ is $|N\rangle$, with $a^{\dagger}a|N\rangle = N|N\rangle$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. The pre-interaction state of a qubit is $|0\rangle$ as aforementioned.
$$H_{rad} = \omega_a |1\rangle\langle 1|$$
$$H_{BH} = \omega_a a^{\dagger}a$$
with $[a,a^{\dagger}]=1$ and $[a,a]=[a^{\dagger},a^{\dagger}]=0$. 
$$H_I = g(|1\rangle\langle 0|a + |0\rangle \langle 1|a^{\dagger})$$
$g$ and $\omega_a$ are largely irrelevant in this paper.
header:Models/cases considered
Variable interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $\langle n \rangle$, the average excitation number of the black hole.
Fixed interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $N$, the initial particle number of the black hole.
Interaction time reduction: $\Delta t_k$ can be reduced by $k_r$ (reduc in the codes) to better induce semiclassicality of spacetime.
Simplified model: Replacing JCM interaction with a more simplified interaction unitary $U$ - for all $|n\rangle$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}$) of the black hole, same entanglement behavior except for $n=0$ (no entanglement).

header:On necessity of quantum gravity (possibly in v2 of the paper, or a separate paper)
See https://mkimacad.github.io/gravity_quantization as the main reference: the JCM model of this paper could be thought of as a thought experiment in the necessity of quantum gravity.
header:Is this a consequence of no hair? (possibly in v2 of the paper)
Sort of yes. If we had degenerate (ie. multiple) ground states, then entanglement entropy could be much larger at late times. So apparently, no hair actually helps us to solve the information problem. (Analyzing the case of degenerate ground states is also a wonderful future topic.)
header:On weirdness of semiclassicality (possibly in v2 of the paper, replacing the previously misleading explanation in this github.io page, though not the paper)
A significant reason why we have so many problems understanding black holes being roughly semiclassical is that entropy decreases due to effects of the empty black hole branch, but the significance of the empty black hole branch seems to instead suggest high energy variance "classically". It is this classical intuition that is wrong in quantum mechanics due to quantum correlations. (Inevitability of entropy and energy variance decreases can be seen from the fact that the number of available black hole microstates decreases significantly at late times.)
The picture we have is that at early times, the central limit theorem (CLT) dominates such that we can add up normal distributions of sub-intervals. As the direction of entropy reverses at late times, this CLT picture no longer holds and variance is actually lower than the maximum variance reached at early times. (Recall that our outcomes and eigenstates are all energy eigenstates. So entropy variance is tied to energy variance.) So as the black hole evaporates, deviations from complete semiclassicality are suppressed enough to assure the validity of the semiclassical picture.
(Note that at early times, Var(X+Y) = Var(X)+Var(Y)+2Cov(X,Y), but the covariance part can be ignored since the entanglement structure does not change much from one interval to another.)
header:The JCM model 'models' absorption as well (not in the paper, nor needed, but possibly in v2)
If a qubit is initialized in $|1\rangle$, then we have the black hole absorbing energy on average instead (the black hole attracts matter-energy), later releasing it back once other qubits are mostly on $|0\rangle$.
header:On temperature-based re-scaling of interaction time and abrupt vacuum change (possibly in v2 of the paper)
While this paper scales interaction time quasi-uniformly, we can adjust interaction time such that it varies with the semiclassical temperature of the black hole. As the black hole becomes smaller, temperature increases, which leads to an abrupt vacuum change right before or after complete evaporation, unless we believe in final remnants. Therefore, a potential counter-argument that the abrupt 'vacuum change' does not arise cannot hold. There is no smooth tranisition to the approximately flat-space horizon. This is a well-understood and established point, so should not be controversial, and indeed the necessity of this abrupt change without remnants has inspired some to accept remnants instead.
header:Extra talks: replica wormholes and Hilbert space factorization (not in the paper)
There could also be workarounds that minimize the partial breakdown of semiclassicality. Essentially, the issue is that the black hole does not exist for some quantum branches, so these branches need to be taken out to the exterior, if we are following the traditional qubit pair picture. This may be achieved by the ideas like replica wormholes - see discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , though note that in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 , Khodahami and Azizi (2024) argues that firewalls can be generated with replica wormholes. If this holds generally, the interior horizon vacuum is not really saved.
Portraying the empty black hole outcome in a superposition within the black hole interior locally is impossible unless some degrees of freedom that were previously assumed to exist is discarded. This effectively causes the EFT Hilbert space to change, along with its factorization. The JCM model did not require such a change, because we are not too concerned with the local reprsentation of the interior. The Hilbert space factorization issue is therefore not an artefact of Karch-Randall braneworld and is definitely not restricted to gauge theories.
header:Some trivial matters: Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.
header:Do we need to replicate the Page curve, given holography of information?
See discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , but some of them are replicated here. In short, confirmation by our familiar local non-gravitational horizon observables is important. Holography of information can be or is correct, but there may still be pathologies around black hole horizons that require understanding. We cannot simply invoke unitarity of quantum physics or AdS/CFT to resolve the information problem, and this is essentially the same thing.
header:Is black hole complementarity or a special 'boundary of a boundary' setup like Karch-Randall braneworld necessary?
No. But they provide convenient ways of directly connecting to quantum gravity calculations.
header:Digression: "remnants" of incomplete fragments that may become relevant
(Also quantization issues, if we do not properly correct states. Complications after complications. It does not seem like these complications are just for black hole setups.)
(And the JCM model of this paper also makes us the very condition of classicality within large-n classicality, but I will stop here for now.)
header: Addendum
Currently working toward V2.B that incorporates parts of the braneworld paper as well that is to be uploaded to arXiv.
