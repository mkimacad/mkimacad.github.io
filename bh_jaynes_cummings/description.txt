header:On simulation code (baseline: codes/jaynes_improved.py)
Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of radiation qubits), N (number of particles in the black hole), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.
header:History (date-wise)
Paper V1/github.io description: mostly around May 25-26, 2025, some May 27, 2025.
header:The main goal of this paper
1) Show that semiclassical spacetime geometry can be consistent with the Page curve,
2) the problem with the small corrections theorem + firewall paradox has to do with empty black hole quantum branches in superpositions.
It is easy to achieve unitarity by violating semiclassical spacetime. Satisfying both goals is what makes the matter difficult. The paper succeeds.
(No-hair, no electricity, no angular momentum -> semiclassical geometry = semiclassical black hole mass (equivalently, energy).)
In this Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model, black hole=(optical) cavity=field, (Hawking) radiations=atom=qubits. $\hslash=1$ is used for convenience.
header:On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Qubits are not fundamental - they are only entropy/entanglement generators. Time can conveniently be re-scaled to fit the Page curve slopes.
header:General storylines
1. Non-interaction energy is conserved. Qubits are initialized with no energy to transfer to the black hole. The black hole probabilistically emits energy via JCM interaction until it reaches its ground state, thereby being purified - unitarity upheld even after complete evaporation.
2. Meanwhile, with small interaction time, semiclassical spacetime geometry with close to zero variance (via central limit theorem + very low variance of each qubit) can be maintained - semiclassical spacetime preserved.
3. This qudit model is almost identical to the toy qubit setup used in black hole physics.
4. The real issue with the black hole information problem is that semiclassical spacetime is often thought to imply that the empty black hole quantum branch of superpositions can be ignored. But contributions of this branch eventually build up, despite semiclassical spacetime. Without the energy lower bound of the black hole, black hole entanglement entropy builds up continuously even in this model.
5. Nothing wrong with EFT: complete evaporation or not, different horizon vacua. The black hole exterior sees nothing strange (horizon vacuum maintained).
6. AMPS firewall and the small corrections theorem went astray because infalling observers do not see the interior horizon vacuum, though they sort of do for each classically measured state $|n\rangle$.
header:JCM interaction setup
1. The JCM interaction (between one qubit and the black hole) of the model says: if a two-energy radiation qubit is in ground state $|0\rangle$ and the black hole has enegy, then the qubit should gain energy to the excited state. If the qubit is in excited state $|1\rangle$ then the black hole should gain energy. Our initial qubit state is always in $|0\rangle$, so the black hole always loses energy until complete evaporation. Governed by $H_I$.
2. Each $k$th qubit, initially in $|0\rangle$ interacts sequentially with the black hole for duration of $\Delta t_k$ ("interaction time"). Then the qubit flies away, never interacting with the black hole again.
3. The initial state of the black hole at $t=0$ is $|N\rangle$, with $a^{\dagger}a|N\rangle = N|N\rangle$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. The pre-interaction state of a qubit is $|0\rangle$ as aforementioned.
$$H_{rad} = \omega_a |1\rangle\langle 1|$$
$$H_{BH} = \omega_a a^{\dagger}a$$
with $[a,a^{\dagger}]=1$ and $[a,a]=[a^{\dagger},a^{\dagger}]=0$. 
$$H_I = g(|1\rangle\langle 0|a + |0\rangle \langle 1|a^{\dagger})$$
$g$ and $\omega_a$ are largely irrelevant in this paper.
header:Models/cases considered
Variable interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $\langle n \rangle$, the average excitation number of the black hole.
Fixed interaction time case: $\Delta t_k$ is determined by $N$, the initial particle number of the black hole.
Interaction time reduction: $\Delta t_k$ can be reduced by $k_r$ (reduc in the codes) to better induce semiclassicality of spacetime.
Simplified model: Replacing JCM interaction with a more simplified interaction unitary $U$ - for all $|n\rangle$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}$) of the black hole, same entanglement behavior except for $n=0$ (no entanglement).

header:Extra talks: replica wormholes (not in the paper)
There could also be workarounds that minimize the partial breakdown of semiclassicality. Essentially, the issue is that the black hole does not exist for some quantum branches, so these branches need to be taken out to the exterior, if we are following the traditional qubit pair picture. This may be achieved by the ideas like replica wormholes - see discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , though note that in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 , Khodahami and Azizi (2024) argues that firewalls can be generated with replica wormholes. If this holds generally, the interior horizon vacuum is not really saved.
header:Some trivial matters: Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.
header:Do we need to replicate the Page curve, given holography of information?
See discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld , but some of them are replicated here. In short, confirmation by our familiar local non-gravitational horizon observables is important. Holography of information can be or is correct, but there may still be pathologies around black hole horizons that require understanding. We cannot simply invoke unitarity of quantum physics or AdS/CFT to resolve the information problem, and this is essentially the same thing.
header:Is black hole complementarity or a special 'boundary of a boundary' setup like Karch-Randall braneworld necessary?
No. But they provide convenient ways of directly connecting to quantum gravity calculations.
