Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of atoms), N (number of photons), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.

header:Some trivial matters (1): Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.
header:Some terms used interchangably and Planck units
Black hole=(optical) cavity=field, (Hawking) radiations=atom=qubits. $\hslash=1$ is used for convenience.
header:Some trivial matters (2): On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Since this is a toy qudit model, time is modelled as the number of qubits that interacted with the black hole. This can be re-scaled to fit the Page curve and so the slope of the entropy curve should not be of concern here. It can also be noted that initial entropy increase can be slowed down (such that increases are almost constant across initially interacting qubits) by tuning down the interaction time of each qubit, or reducing coupling constant $g$ equivalently.
header:Do we need to replicate the Page curve, given holography of information?
See discussions in https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld, but some of them are replicated here. In short, confirmation by our familiar local non-gravitational horizon observables is important. Holography of information can be or is correct, but there may still be pathologies around black hole horizons that require understanding. We cannot simply invoke unitarity of quantum physics or AdS/CFT to resolve the information problem, and this is essentially the same thing.
header:Interaction setup
Each $k$th qubit, initially in $|0\rangle$ interacts sequentially with the black hole for duration of $\Delta t_k$ ("interaction time") from $t=\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\Delta t_j$ to $t=\sum_{j=1}^k \Delta t_j$. The Hamiltonian governing this interaction is provided by the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) - the black hole being an optical cavity and qubits being atoms. Then this qubit flies away, never interacting with the black hole again.
header:Hamiltonians
The free Hamiltonian $H_{rad}$ of each qubit is given as, with qubit states satisfying $\langle 0|1\rangle =0$:
$$H_{rad} = \omega_a \sigma_{+}\sigma_{-} = \omega_a |1\rangle\langle 1|$$
This is simply about only the excited state of the qubit having non-zero energy, with $\sigma_{+}=|1\rangle\langle 0|$ and $\sigma_{-}=|0\rangle\langle 1|$.
The free Hamiltonian $H_{BH}$ of the black hole is given as:
$$H_{BH} = \omega_a a^{\dagger}a$$
with commutation relations $[a,a^{\dagger}]=1$ and $[a,a]=[a^{\dagger},a^{\dagger}]=0$. This gives us $|n\rangle$ with particle number operator $\hat{n}=a^{\dagger}a$ such that $\hat{n}|n\rangle=n|n\rangle$.
Now most importantly, the JCM interaction Hamiltonian that couples $\textbf{one}$ qubit and the black hole goes as:
$$H_I = g(\sigma_{+}a + \sigma_{-}a^{\dagger})$$
Since we have same $\omega_a$ in the free Hamiltonians, this JCM interaction is all about trading non-interaction energy: if the black hole loses energy $\omega_a$, then the qubit obtains $\omega_a$ and vice versa. The total number of 'particles' and non-interaction energy are conserved in the model. There is no need to vary $g$ in this paper, so $g=1$ is set. The value of $\omega_a$ is also irrelevant for rest of the discussions. 
header:Variable interaction time case
The final outgoing state of the $k$th qubit is determined with unitary $U_k$: 
$$U_k|0,n\rangle = \cos(g\sqrt{n}\Delta t_k)|0,n\rangle -i\sin(g\sqrt{n}\Delta t_k)|1,n-1\rangle$$
where $|q_1,q_2\rangle$ refers to $q_1 \in \{0,1\}$ ($k$th qubit), $q_2 \in \{0,1,..,N\}$ (black hole).
For variable interaction time $\Delta t_k$, we choose
$$\Delta t_k = \frac{\pi}{4g\sqrt{\langle n_k \rangle}}$$
where $\langle n_k\rangle$ is average excitation numbers in the black hole (or optical cavity, in JCM terms). This matches the semiclassical requirement of the small corrections theorem that must reproduce up to phase, for $\langle n_k\rangle \in \mathbb{N}$,
$$U_k|0,\langle n_k\rangle\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(|0,\langle n_k\rangle\rangle + |1,\langle n_k\rangle-1\rangle\right)$$
header:Fixed interaction time case
We can instead fix interaction time as constant $\Delta t_k = \Delta t$ ($U_k=U$) such that:
$$\Delta t = \frac{\pi}{4g\sqrt{N}}$$
reproducing only for $n=N$ up to phase,
$$U|0,N\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(|0,N\rangle+|1,N-1\rangle\right)$$   
header:Simplified model
We can modify interaction unitary $U_k=U$ (fixed interaction time case) to be slightly different from the JCM case such that for $0\lineq n$,
$$U|0,n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\left(|0,n\rangle+|1,n-1\rangle\right)$$
while for $n=0$,
$$U|0,0\rangle = |0,0\rangle$$
This simplified model continues to respect conservation of non-interaction energy. The model is analytically simpler and can be beneficial for those insisting on the same interaction behavior regardless of $n$. We arrive at the same conclusions qualitatively regardless of the models used. Even ignoring conservation of non-interaction energy for $|0,0\rangle$ such that qubits get superposition $(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, we should get the same entropy conclusions, since there is no actual entanglement being generated.
header:Reduced interaction time case
Interaction time $\Delta t_k$ or coupling constant $g$ can be reduced by factor $k_r$ such that more $M$ is allowed for the given time. As $M$ becomes larger, the total energy emitted becomes more semiclassical due to the central limit theorem (CLT). The simplest model to explore this is the simplified model. $U$ now instead generates for $0\lineq n$,
$$U|0,n\rangle = \cos(\pi/(4k_r))|0,n\rangle+\sin(\pi/(4k_r))|1,n-1\rangle$$
while for $n=0$,
$$U|0,0\rangle = |0,0\rangle$$
If we can ignore the empty black hole case, variance in energy emitted per each qubit $Var[E_{k,rad}]$ goes as:
$$Var[E_{k,rad}] = \langle (E_{k,rad})^2\rangle-(\langle E_{k,rad}\rangle)^2 = \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4k_r}\right) - \sin^4\left(\frac{\pi}{4k_r}\right)$$
CLT says that for $K$ such identical qubits, with $\sigma^2=Var[E_{k,rad}]$:
$$K E_{k,rad}-K\langle E_{k,rad}\rangle \mathrel{\overset{d}{\longrightarrow}} \mathcal{N}\left(0,K\sigma^2\right)$$
It can be noted that variance is lowered approximately by factor of $(1/k_r)^2$ as $k_r$ is varied, while time is reduced by $1/k_r$, achieving the goal of enlarging the number of interacting qubits within the same time duration. The point is that with large $k_r$, we see practically zero variance in energy emitted from the semiclssical prediction.

header:Large-M,Large-N,small interaction time behavior
To be updated, this is the most important part to understand about the black hole horizon.
header:Where the small corrections theorem and the AMPS firewall subadditivity paradox got wrong - or the imprecise meaning of "semiclassical no-drama horizon"
Updates coming up.
header:Effective dimension of the black hole Hilbert space, as relating to the small corrections theorem
The small corrections theorem assumes that the effective black hole Hilbert space dimension can increase over time. However, can we really assume so? We can argue that the point of the small corrections theorem is to say that our usual semiclassical picture requires such increases, and the contents of this paper clarify why we can still have some form of semiclassicality and yet effective dimension must decrease over time.
header:Exterior horizon understanding at late times (Large-M)
Semiclassicality is valid. The sheer amout M means that the central limit theorem (CLT, and the law of large numbers (LLN) ) kicks in especially for total amount of energy emitted to the exterior so far. The spacetime should therefore see nothing special, and this should hold for the interior horizon as well. To take advantage of large M, one may consider reducing the interaction time in the code in order to invoke CLT/LLN.
It may be argued that qubit variance varies over time such that CLT is not applicable. After reducing interacting time and considering some relatively small time duration, we can apply CLT for this sub-region, which means that energy emitted is reliably semiclassical. The no-hair picture maintained, soft hairs are not the source of information transfer.
In short, $\textbf{Spacetime geometry semiclassicality is valid}$, but see below. 
header:Interior horizon understanding at late times
In short, $\textbf{Interior horizon is not EFT vacuum}$, violating this part of semiclassicality. However, the idea like replica wormholes can have potentials to save the interior horizon state as a vacuum at the cost of modifying EFT or implicitly modifying quantum states anyway.
While the total energy emitted remains semiclassical, the mixed superposition state of the interior is messy - some branches/outcomes that just collapsed to the ground state reduces entropy - when such entropy reduction is greater than entropy increase, then entropy curve starts to decrease. EFT-wise, the ground state would be understood as complete evaporation, and no one would argue that even in such a case would entanglement be generated.
Therefore, it is not really the EFT that is part of the problem. It is the insistence that EFT should radiate away energy and generate entanglement even when a particular branch/outcome already has black holes fully evaporated that leads to a paradoxical result.
Except for the black hole ground state, each black hole excited state interacts the way we expect with exterior qubits, generating monotonic entanglement increases.
If the spacetime geometry (which encodes energy of the black hole) can safely provide the quantum state of the interior horizon approximately, then we cannot avoid the small corrections theorem. The problem is that we cannot safely provide the state despite semiclassical stability of the spacetime geometry based on total energy emitted, and there is nothing wrong with semiclassical EFT.

To be updated
header:Historical reference: Wen's JCM model of black holes.
Wen's JCM model is at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135348 .
Wen uses the JCM model with a reflective cavity such that reflected photons can re-interact with the black hole atom. We notice some differences: Wen uses atoms as black holes instead of a cavity as a black hole. A black hole atom is embedded in a reflective cavity in Wen's model. This is in contrast to a typical black hole setup where Hawking radiations are outgoing radiations that can be seen at radial future infinity. Therefore, despite sharing JCM, there are different realities involved.
Wen's model replicates the Parikh-Wilczek (PW) non-thermal spectrum and provides its quantum toy model description, as wella as somewhat periodic entanglement entropy curve, with entropy decreases understood to provide a potential mechanism of information transfer. However, the setup of the model limits it from replicating the full restoration of unitarity and complete evaporation, and entropy tends to bounce up and down instead.
