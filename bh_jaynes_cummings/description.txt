header:On simulation code (baseline: codes/jaynes_improved.py)
Main parameters at the end (currently line 368 # parameters):
M (number of atoms), N (number of photons), reduc (multiplicative factor by which interaction time is reduced).
The codes model the interaction Hamiltonian only, but this is fine since "free Hamiltonians" are irrelevant in interactions here.
header:Some trivial matters (1): Initial "cavity"/black hole state choice, some terminology equivalence
In this paper $|N\rangle$ is chosen as an initial state. We can go more realistically and choose a 'Gaussian' state of different excitation states (which fits a semiclassical state better) without much difference.
Black hole=(Optical) Cavity, (Hawking) radiations=Atom qubits
header:Some trivial matters (2): On "time" in this modified Jaynes-Cummings (JCM) model
Since this is a toy qudit model, time is modelled as the number of qubits that interacted with the black hole. This can be re-scaled to fit the Page curve and so the slope of the entropy curve should not be of concern here. It can also be noted that initial entropy increase can be slowed down (such that increases are almost constant across initially interacting qubits) by tuning down the interaction time of each qubit, which is available in the baseline code by reduc parameter.
header:Large-M,Large-N,small interaction time behavior
To be updated, this is the most important part to understand about the black hole horizon.
header:Some trivial matters (3): On M'~N behaviors on the entropy curve. (Not in the paper, likely to be removed here as well since unnecessary - move to othermemos.txt)
Let M' be the number of outgoing qubits (and will no longer interact). In the entropy curve, for M'~N, the distribution of excited states in the black hole settles something similar to Gaussian distributions such that we can treat entropy increase to be approximately constant. [variance M'/4, total energy variance lower..]
