header:History (date-wise, to be updated)
Submitted to IJQI a year ago but reviewer availability issues + misunderstanding issues.
New perspectives a year later, especially with regards to the Peres-Terno hybrid classical-quantum system argument.
(To be updated)
header:Main question
How do we treat a classical system in quantum mechanics? Can we really discuss a hybrid classical-quantum system that makes sense within quantum mechanics?
The Peres-Terno argument suggests that this is infeasible. But is it?
header:Setup
A classical subsystem defined not as a subspace of the universe Hilbert space, but more as a dynamically changing subsapce of the unvierse Hamiltonian.
This is actually consistent with the fact that a classical system is non-linear.
Combine this with the fact that in quantum gravity, Hilbert space factorization becomes very unsettling. (See https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld .)
We want the classical (sub)system to have commuting observables, while also satisfying the correspondence principle when interacting with the quantum (sub)system.
Suppose we have time-independent Hamiltonian $H$. Factorize it in two descriptions (or factorizations):
$$H = H_{cl}(t) + H_{qm} + H_I + H_z(t) = H_c + H_{qm} + H_I$$
$$H_{cl}(t) + H_z(t) = H_c$$
$H_{cl}$: (actual) classical system Hamiltonian, $H_{qm}$: quantum system Hamiltonian (pre-defined). 
Note time-dependence of $H_{cl}$ and $H_z$.
$H_c$: the usual time-independent pre-quantized classical system Hamiltonian we write. If we use the $H_c$ description, then the classical system is actually quantum. 
header:Intuition 1: adiabatic computing ground state logic
If $H_{cl}(t)$ changes slowly, and the initial classical system is a classical state, then we know from adiabatic quantum computing that if the classical system evolves only by $H_{cl}(t)$ then the evolution is approximately a sequence of instantaneous ground states as long as $H_{cl}$ changes slowly.
header:Intuition 2: freedom in entanglement shifting due to a breakdown in Hilbert space factorization
Since we freely broke Hilbert space factorization, we can let the classical system evolve in pure states and let the required entanglement be shifted to system $z$.
That is:
$$[H_{cl}(t),H_I] = 0,\,\,\,\,[H_{cl}(t),H_{qm}]=0$$
What happens then is that the classical system $cl$ evolves approximately as instantaneous ground states of $H_{cl}(t)$, while $H_z$ takes care of entanglement (due to $H_I$) that would have been required for $H_c$.
header:Intuition 3: Instantaneous ground states of $H_{cl}$ computed from the semiclassical equations of motion
As said in the header. These computed ground states constrain $H_{cl}$. The correspondence principle is automatically satisfied, as long as the classical system $cl$ evolves as its ground states.
header:Intuition 4: we really need to assure $H_{cl}(t)$ to change slowly
This is because Intuition 1 only works when $H_{cl}(t)$ changes slowly. Therefore, we cannot make the ground states of $H_{cl}(t)$ to exactly fit the computed ground states from the semiclassical equations of motion - we need to find a smooth out the evolutions such that variation of $H_{cl}$ is slow enough.

header:End result
We have classical system $cl$ evolving purely, approximated as the evolution in instaneous ground states, which match with the semiclassical equations of motion approximately. Meanwhile quantum system $qm$ is unaffected by the change in factorizations. System $z$ absorbs the entanglement that $cl$ threw away.
In this picture, there is no fixed Hilbert space factorization between $cl$, $qm$ and $z$:
$$\mathcal H \neq \mathcal H_{cl} \otimes \mathcal H_z \otimes \mathcal H_{qm}$$
$$\mathcal H = \mathcal H_c \otimes \mathcal H_{qm}$$
