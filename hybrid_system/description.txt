A classical subsystem defined not as a subspace of the universe Hilbert space, but more as a dynamically changing subsapce of the unvierse Hamiltonian.
This is actually consistent with the fact that a classical system is non-linear.
Combine this with the fact that in quantum gravity, Hilbert space factorization becomes very unsettling. (See https://mkimacad.github.io/braneworld .) 
Suppose we have time-independent Hamiltonian $H$. Divide it as follows:
$$H = H_{cl}(t) + H_{qm} + H_I(t)$$
$H_I$ can be thought of as the interaction Hamiltonian, but here it takes more of a residual role as to make $H_{cl}(t)$ work.
$H_{cl}$: classical system Hamiltonian, $H_{qm}$: quantum system Hamiltonian (pre-defined). 
Note time-dependence of $H_{cl}$ and $H_I$.
If $H_{cl}(t)$ changes slowly, and the initial classical system is a classical state, then we know from adiabatic quantum computing that if the classical system evolves only by $H_{cl}(t)$ then the evolution is approximately a sequence of instantaneous ground states.
When the quantum system is in its ground state, then the energy can only flow from the classical system to the quantum system.
