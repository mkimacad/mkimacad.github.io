header:Oh well
I tried to update on the old manuscript but decided not to.
I am not going to work on it.
But my idea was that a classical subsystem in a hybrid classical-quantum system can be represented as instantaneous ground states..
So you can think of the classical subsystem as sort of pure states in the effective representation. This is obviously semiclassical coarse-graining..
But maybe classical observables in QM are supposed to be non-linear, so this may be fine.
Adiabatic quantum computing: evolution is ground states if Hamiltonian is varied slowly.
Each ground state is interpreted as an appropriate classical configuration, we do not care rest of unrealized states. 
The real issue involved is how we smooth out the classical mean-field prediction such that slow-varying of classical subsystem Hamiltonian in the effective representation can be met.
