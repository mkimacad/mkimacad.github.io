header:What do we mean by holography anyway?
What many use as AdS/CFT today is a mostly watered down version of the original AdS/CFT, between a classical bulk theory and a quantum boundary theory.
Justification: typically we have a strongly-coupled quantum boundary theory that we have a hard time solving. Since we have a dual weakly-coupled bulk theory with stable background space ("classical" terms completely dominate), we can approximate quantum calculations with classical bulk calculations instead.
And for a weakly-coupled boundary theory, we have a strongly-coupled bulk theory, so why even bother holography - solve the original boundary theory instead.
But this can only go far.
header:Three layers of holography
$e^{-S_{bulk,cl}}|_{\phi_0}$, $\int d\phi\,e^{-S_{bulk}}|_{\phi_0}$, $\int d\phi dg\,e^{-S_{bulk}}|_{\phi_0}(?)$.
The third case should actually be understood as representing quantum gravity theory and not literally.
All of them hold to different approximatie senses.
But the first one requires solving classical equations of motion and when we do in AdS/CFT, we realize that boundary conditions need to be chosen to avoid pathological outcomes.
So technically, if we already have initial boundary data $\phi_0$, then with the boundary condition, we get the classical bulk field.
This can fool us to think that the bulk theory is non-local, but it obviously is a local quantum field theory, if we consider at the non-classical but effective field theory level.
This means that distant boundaries must approximately "commute". Action-wise, this means that the bulk action satisfies the score criterion.
But if we take the known fixed-background holographic bulk action, then the score criterion is obviously not satisfied.
This is because these three layers of holography eventually produce different answers.
header:Score criterion
$$\nabla_{\phi_{b1}}S_{bulk}|_{\phi_{b2}} = \nabla_{\phi_{b1}}S_{b1}$$
where $b1$, $b2$ are any boundary. $b2$ can be multiple boundaries.
Intuitively, it is logically simple - if holography is true, then boundary actions must directly affect bulk action.
In case of the UV boundary, its physics must hold regardless of IR boundary fields. Therefore, the score criterion holds.
In case of the IR boundary, because it is distant from the UV boundary, the bulk should have no mean of producing non-local bulk outcomes.
(Two distant boundary operators approximately "commute".) Therefore, the score criterion holds.
It is this score criterion that we use in AdS/PINN to train neural network bulks, based on sampled boundary field data.
header:Away from generative learning and toward supervised physics-informed neural network learning
Key dictum: stop trying to obtain and sample from boundary data probability. Instead, try to learn the action of the quantum bulk theory, not the classical bulk theory.
So samplers used in AdS/PINN do not care about sampling according to boundary partition function. Indeed, covering small-probability cases are actually crucial for learning the action properly. From that point of view, the currently implemented samplers in the code are actually inefficient.
header:The score mechanism can be replaced with other score mechanisms
After all, you can instead choose for the score criterion:
$$\nabla_{\phi_{b1}}S_{bulk}|_{\phi_{b2}(\phi_{b1})} = \nabla_{\phi_{b1}}S_{b1}$$
where $\phi_{b2}$ is a function of $\phi_{b1}$. Then an additional neural network that guess this $\phi_{b2}$ has to be considered, and the guess for neural networks is corrected as other examples arrive, suggesting the initial guess to be wrong and so forth.
The score mechanism is simply physics-informed neural network thing, where we match action derivatives. Nothing more, nothing less. It is general.
