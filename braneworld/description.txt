header:Main lessons
1) Non-gravitational observables, conventional Hilbert space factorization should work. But no assurance for the bulk gravity side.
Information on the black hole interior eventually needs to escape (entanglement structure is not enough), so this is a good thing.
2) As noted in the JCM model paper (https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings ), the semiclassical horizon can actually be structurally complicated in the interior. EFT calculations that do not factor this in will be wrong. In Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld holography, we have a dual boundary EFT as well, where computations can potentially be done reliably. Assuming validity of the entanglement wedge duality, the matter is simpler. Bulk EFT is corrected according to the entanglement wedge duality. In reality, it is not really the bulk EFT that is being corrected but the bulk state of the universe that is being corrected.
3) As noted in the JCM model paper, islands are means to highlight that some information is already not in the interior/brane ('empty interior/brane' branch of a quantum superposition). 
4) The entanglement wedge duality actually restores holography to spacetime that perturbs (or truncates) global AdS, for which the Terashima-Sugishita results say naive holography ill-defined.

header:Is the Page curve needed?
Holography of information suggests that information on the black hole interior is actually always on the exterior, since quantum gravity observables work differently. If so, the Page curve may be unnecessary.
I do think that demonstrating the Page curve in near-horizon terms is important, because this is where we check by our conventional non-gravitational observables that information is transferred locally and is not lost. There may be reasons why these observables cannot replicate the Page curve, but I think this is yet to be shown. So the Page curve remains a valid goal.
Furthermore, in holographic gravity, a quantum gravity theory is dual to a non-gravitational theory. This gives us an opportunity to check how information flows in terms of non-gravitational observables. That should afford us the Page curve if evolution is unitary. In this regard, Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld offers a nice setup to explore the non-gravitational side of the story.
Indeed, you could say that this point was a key initial motivation for this paper. Holography of information may be a key to understanding KR braneworld. Bulk-wise entanglement entropy calculations may be unreliable, as we are in quantum gravity. And see below.
header:On some characteristics of Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld.
KR braneworlds are nice in that they sort of mimic (though not exactly) the idea that information is encoded on the black hole horizon. In the BCFT representation, we have $D$-dimensional standard boundary interacting with $D-1$-dimensional brane, which is on the boundary of the standard boundary. So this brane acts as information emitter without having to have information escaping the black hole via some wormhole.
header:Is KR braneworld necessary to justify the toy qudit model of the paper?
No. This leads to https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings . But it is true that 'the horizon having all information about the black hole interior' provides the simplest explanation.
The JCM model in the link demonstrates an important aspect of black hole physics. As radiations fly by, one quantum branch of superpositions will feature an empty black hole. This branch cannot be modeled as if the black hole interior exists, so within semiclassical spacetime, islands on the interior must appear to mark that they are really part of the exterior. This is why trusting bulk EFT calculations without doubt is dangerous in KR braneworld setups. A part of the interior is sort of gone, yet EFT calculations and even classical calculations suppose that it is there. This is not at the level of small quantum corrections but at the classical level.  
header:Can't AdS-Rindler paradoxes nicely be resolved by the recent crossed-product construction?
Maybe. If the construction works generally, then semiclassicality is no longer required. Potentially, the construction allows us to make precise what we mean by subregion complementarity - different subregions can encode the same information. However, we do not know whether true finite-N corrections save the construction, and it is to be seen whether it works generally. Even in such a case, the point about bulk Hilbert space factorization ambiguities remains. In fact, the construction suggests implicit observer dependence, marked by modular automorphism groups.    
header:What Terashima-Sugishita tell us
The conventional subregion holography dictionary does not work generally beyond the semiclassical entangled setup. Generally, Hilbert space factorization may not match between the bulk and the boundary. Recently, the crossed-product construction is gaining ground, where observer dependence is implicitly embedded into modular automorpshim groups. This can make the subregion duality precise - we no longer need semiclaasical treatments, and subregion-localized states may be studied within the subregion CFT/subregion bulk duality. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the crossed-product construction works generally.
For KR braneworld, since it involves truncating AdS, Terashima-Sugishita suggest that the holography dictionary has to be checked carefully in order for the entanglement wedge duality to hold. Indeed, islands are witnesses to this issue, and if the duality is saved, then bulk EFT has to be corrected.
header:Entanglement wedge in KR braneworld is problematic, but the entanglement wedge duality is more durable than validity of bulk EFT
The entanglement wedge of the standard boundary often intersects with the KR brane. The natural geometric interpretation implies that information on the brane is shared by information on the boundary. Yet this is disallowed in the non-graviational (boundary) side.
But this does not require us throw away the entanglement wedge duality - it may actually suggest that the bulk has Hilbert space factorization problem.. and holography of information already suggests it. But entanglement wedge and calculating entropy are still valid from the non-gravtational theory point of view.
With formation of islands (which is necessary if KR braneworld tells anything about black hole evaporation, as aforementioned), this problem becomes more fundamental. The boundary and the bulk have different pictures as to how the Hilbert space is factorized.
Of course we should trust the boundary picture - the bulk is about quantum gravity that we understand little!
header:Small corrections theorem and black hole paradoxes
This paper highlights the bulk Hilbert space factorization issue as why the small corrections theorem breaks down. Bulk EFT entropy calculations become unreliable, and boundary calculations have different local structures, so the horizon behavior is different. The toy qudit model illustrates this in a BCFT-like setup. However, eventually we see that this is not the real problem in https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings .
header:Islands from the entanglement wedge duality: planar black string model (only briefly mentioned in the paper, explored further here)
This part was largely dropped since it was not in the first version of the paper, and the paper was anyway very close to publication at the time. It is not my model, and is in https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)153 (Geng 2022). Basically, islands recovered just from extremal surface calculations, which really are pure geometrical. So as long as the entanglement wedge duality and the extremal surface formula are valid, trust the boundary theory Hilbert space for the purpose of the Page curve. 
The metric of the bulk $\mathrm{AdS}_{d+1}$ space with a black hole is given as:
$$ds^2 = \frac{1}{u^2 \sin^2\mu}\left[-h(u) dt^2 + \frac{du^2}{h(u)} + d\vec{x}^2 + u^2 d\mu^2\right]$$
$$h(u) = 1 - \frac{u^{d-1}}{u_h^{d-1}}$$
where $u > 0$, $\theta_b \leq \mu < \pi$ and $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d-2}$, with the blackening factor $h(u)$ and anchor (end)point $\Gamma = u_a/u_h$ with $u$-coordinate $u_a=u(u_a)$. Radiation region $R$, depending on time $t$, scales over time, following the trajectory of old and new radiations over time, with the endpoint defined by $\Gamma$, assuming symmetry between the two non-brane CFT copies.
The objective then is to find the extremal surface homologous to $R$ satisfying boundary conditions as to extremize area density function $\mathcal{A}$ (which is derived from the metric) by varying functional $u = u(\mu)$ that traces the extremal surface.
$$\mathcal{A} = \int_{\theta_b}^{\pi} \frac{d\mu}{(u\sin\mu)^{d-1}} \sqrt{u^2 + \frac{u'(\mu)^2}{h(u)}}$$
The boundary conditions are given by the Neumann condition at the brane and the Dirichlet condition at the boundary, along with an additional orthogonal crossing condition for intersecting the black string horizon in case of the Hartman-Maldacena surface to allow smooth crossing via the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Assuming validly that $u(\mu)$ is an invertible function such that function $\mu(u)$ can be defined, the resulting equation of motion for $u(\mu)$ is given by:
$$u'' = -(d-2) u\,h(u) + (d-1) u' \cot\mu \left(1 - \frac{\tan\mu}{2} \frac{u'}{u\,h(u)} + \frac{u'^2}{u^2\,h(u)}\right)- \left(\frac{d-5}{2}\right) \frac{u'^2}{u}$$
with the boundary condition given for the Hartman-Maldacena (HM) surface (conventional extremal surface) given by:
$$\mu(u_h \Gamma)=\pi, \hspace{1cm} \mu(u_{h}) = \theta_{HM}, \hspace{1cm} \mu'(u_{h}) = \frac{2 \cot \theta_{HM}}{u_{h}}$$
and the boundary condition given for the island surface given by:
$$u(\pi) = u_h\Gamma, \hspace{1cm} u(\theta_b) = u_b, \hspace{1cm} u'(\theta_b) = 0$$
Between the HM surface and the island surface, we choose the surface that has minimal area as the extremal surface. The existence of the island surface depends on $\theta_b > \theta_c$ for $d>2$, where $\theta_c$ would be the critical angle due to the $-(d-2)u\,h(u)$ term.
The picture from Geng (2022) (CC-BY 4.0) goes as:

So islands follow from the extremal surface formula, describing when bulk Hilbert space factorization breaks down, requiring bulk EFT or (equivalently) bulk state corrections/transitions. The picture is also beautiful - at late times, early-time modes deep inside the brane have to be treated as if they already escape to the exterior/non-brane. The planar black string model affirms this view. 
What about the model in the paper? 
header:Digression: replica wormholes (not in the paper) (1)
See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings for some relevant details. Euclidan graviational path integrals incorporating additional replica topolgies modify the theory but without actually changing the underlying theory. This reflects the idea that as black holes are completely emptied in some quantum "branches"/instances or worlds in some superposition, no radiation can be generated so information must be represented as if the interior and the exterior share the same information - bulk-wise Hilbert space factorization change, again. However, the interior horizon vacuum version of semiclassicality may not be ensured according to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 .
It could be said that replica wormholes actually correct "quantum states", given that gravitational path integrals are done in Euclidean time, corresponding to the breakdown of bulk Hilbert space factorization. The line between theory and states can be blurry, especially given that Euclidean QFTs may be the ones that provide the actual meaning of QFTs - at least mathematically rigorously. Cast in terms of real-time QFT, we could say that Euclidean QFTs properly correct Minkowski QFTs after analytic continuation. 
We know that path integrals (especially in Euclidean space) alone cannot justify unitarity and logical consistency, though the question is how would they be valid approximately. It can be easily seen that in case of theoretically pathological spacetime but empirically imaginable spacetime, we get non-unitary QFT that is allowed by path integrals but disallowed by established quantization procedures.
