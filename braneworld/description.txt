header:Question 1: is Page curve needed?
Holography of information suggests that information on the black hole interior is actually always on the exterior, since quantum gravity observables work differently. If so, then some arguments say that the Page curve is unnecessary.
I am on the side that demonstrating the Page curve in near-horizon terms is important, because this is where we check by our conventional non-gravitational observables that information is transferred locally and is not lost. There may be reasons why these observables cannot replicate the Page curve, but I think this is yet to be shown. So the Page curve remains a valid goal.
Furthermore, in holographic gravity, a quantum gravity theory is dual to a non-gravitational theory. This gives us an opportunity to check how information flows in terms of non-gravitational observables. That should afford us the Page curve if evolution is unitary. In this regard, Karch-Randall braneworld offers a nice setup to explore the non-gravitational side of the story.
header:On some characteristics of Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld.
KR braneworlds are nice in that they sort of mimic (though not exactly) the idea that information is encoded on the black hole horizon. In the BCFT representation, we have $D$-dimensional standard boundary interacting with $D-1$-dimensional brane, which is on the boundary of the standard boundary. So this brane acts as information emitter without having to have information escaping the black hole via some wormhole.
header:Is KR braneworld necessary to justify the toy qudit model of the paper?
No. This leads to https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings . But it is true that 'the horizon having all information about the black hole interior' provides the simplest explanation.
header:Black string model (only briefly mentioned in the paper, explored further here)
To be updated. This part was dropped since it was not in the first version of the paper, and the paper was anyway very close to publication at the time. I explain it here more in depth.
header:Digression: replica wormholes (not in the paper) (1)
See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings for some relevant details. Euclidan graviational path integrals incorporating additional replica topolgies modify the theory but without actually changing the underlying theory. This reflects the idea that as black holes are completely emptied in some quantum "branches"/instances or worlds in some superposition, no radiation can be generated so information must be represented as if the interior and the exterior share the same information - bulk-wise Hilbert space factorization change, again. However, the interior horizon vacuum version of semiclassicality may not be ensured according to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 .
It could be said that replica wormholes actually correct "quantum states", given that gravitational path integrals are done in Euclidean time, corresponding to the breakdown of bulk Hilbert space factorization. The line between theory and states can be blurry, especially given that Euclidean QFTs may be the ones that provide the actual meaning of QFTs - at least mathematically rigorously. Cast in terms of real-time QFT, we could say that Euclidean QFTs properly correct Minkowski QFTs after analytic continuation. 
We know that path integrals (especially in Euclidean space) alone cannot justify unitarity and logical consistency, though the question is how would they be valid approximately. It can be easily seen that in case of theoretically pathological spacetime but empirically imaginable spacetime, we get non-unitary QFT that is allowed by path integrals but disallowed by established quantization procedures.
header:Digression: On the Terashima-Sugishita paradox and the crossed-product construction (not in the paper)
Recently, the crossed-product construction is gaining ground, where observer dependence is implicitly embedded into modular automorpshim groups. This can make the subregion duality precise - we no longer need semiclaasical treatments, and subregion-localized states may be studied within the subregion CFT/subregion bulk duality. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the crossed-product construction works generally.
