header:Digression: replica wormholes (not in the paper) (1)
To be copied. See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings for some relevant details. Instead of fixing black hole interior horizon states, we can understand replica wormholes as modifying EFT such that the interior horizon can be treated as if it is the same exterior horizon vacuum. Euclidan graviational path integrals incorporating additional replica topolgies modify the theory but without actually changing the underlying theory. This reflects the idea that as black holes are completely emptied in some quantum "branches"/instances, no radiation can be generated so information must be represented as if the interior and the exterior share the same information - bulk-wise Hilbert space factorization change, again.

As Samir Mathur has argued, replica wormholes are really only state changes and not dynamic theory changes, since we work in Euclidean theory for replica wormholes. However, the line between theory and states can be blurry, especially given that Euclidean QFTs may be the ones that provide the actual meaning of QFTs - at least mathematically rigorously. Cast in terms of real-time QFT, we could say that Euclidean QFTs properly correct Minkowski QFTs after analytic continuation.

The idea that path integrals can alone justify unitarity and logical consistency of replica wormholes can be thought of different examples. It can be easily seen that in case of theoretically pathological spacetime but empirically imaginable spacetime, we get non-unitary QFT that is allowed by path integrals but disallowed by established quantization procedures.
It is possible that path integrals actually point out that non-unitary EFT may be used as long as we are assured of its approximate validity, and replica wormholes can be used safely. I personally agree that people neglect too much of the possibility that path integrals disallowed by canonical quantization can still nevertheless effectively be valid, as long as we recognize their approximate nature. Whether this is actually the case is another matter.
