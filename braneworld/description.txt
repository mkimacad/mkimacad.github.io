header:Is the Page curve needed?
Holography of information suggests that information on the black hole interior is actually always on the exterior, since quantum gravity observables work differently. If so, the Page curve may be unnecessary.
I do think that demonstrating the Page curve in near-horizon terms is important, because this is where we check by our conventional non-gravitational observables that information is transferred locally and is not lost. There may be reasons why these observables cannot replicate the Page curve, but I think this is yet to be shown. So the Page curve remains a valid goal.
Furthermore, in holographic gravity, a quantum gravity theory is dual to a non-gravitational theory. This gives us an opportunity to check how information flows in terms of non-gravitational observables. That should afford us the Page curve if evolution is unitary. In this regard, Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld offers a nice setup to explore the non-gravitational side of the story.
Indeed, you could say that this point was a key initial motivation for this paper. Holography of information may be a key to understanding KR braneworld. Bulk-wise entanglement entropy calculations may be unreliable, as we are in quantum gravity. And see below.
header:On some characteristics of Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld.
KR braneworlds are nice in that they sort of mimic (though not exactly) the idea that information is encoded on the black hole horizon. In the BCFT representation, we have $D$-dimensional standard boundary interacting with $D-1$-dimensional brane, which is on the boundary of the standard boundary. So this brane acts as information emitter without having to have information escaping the black hole via some wormhole.
header:Is KR braneworld necessary to justify the toy qudit model of the paper?
No. This leads to https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings . But it is true that 'the horizon having all information about the black hole interior' provides the simplest explanation.
The JCM model in the link demonstrates an important aspect of black hole physics. As radiations fly by, one quantum branch of superpositions will feature an empty black hole. This branch cannot be modeled as if the black hole interior exists, so within semiclassical spacetime, islands on the interior must appear to mark that they are really part of the exterior. This is why trusting bulk EFT calculations without doubt is dangerous in KR braneworld setups. A part of the interior is sort of gone, yet EFT calculations and even classical calculations suppose that it is there. This is not at the level of small quantum corrections but at the classical level.  
header:Can't AdS-Rindler paradoxes nicely be resolved by the recent crossed-product construction?
Maybe. If the construction works generally, then semiclassicality is no longer required. Potentially, the construction allows us to make precise what we mean by subregion complementarity - different subregions can encode the same information. However, we do not know whether true finite-N corrections save the construction, and it is to be seen whether it works generally. Even in such a case, the point about bulk Hilbert space factorization ambiguities remains. In fact, the construction suggests implicit observer dependence, marked by modular automorphism groups.    
header:What Terashima-Sugishita tell us
The conventional subregion holography dictionary does not work generally beyond the semiclassical entangled setup. Generally, Hilbert space factorization may not match between the bulk and the boundary. Recently, the crossed-product construction is gaining ground, where observer dependence is implicitly embedded into modular automorpshim groups. This can make the subregion duality precise - we no longer need semiclaasical treatments, and subregion-localized states may be studied within the subregion CFT/subregion bulk duality. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the crossed-product construction works generally.
header:Entanglement wedge in KR braneworld is already problematic
The entanglement wedge of the standard boundary intersects with the KR brane. The natural geometric interpretation implies that information on the brane is shared by information on the boundary. Yet this is disallowed in the non-graviational (boundary) side.
But this does not require us throw away the entanglement wedge duality - it may actually suggest that the bulk has Hilbert space factorization problem.. and holography of information already suggests it. But entanglement wedge and calculating entropy are still valid from the non-gravtational theory point of view.
header:Black string model (only briefly mentioned in the paper, explored further here)
To be updated. This part was dropped since it was not in the first version of the paper, and the paper was anyway very close to publication at the time. I explain it here more in depth.
header:Digression: replica wormholes (not in the paper) (1)
See https://mkimacad.github.io/bh_jaynes_cummings for some relevant details. Euclidan graviational path integrals incorporating additional replica topolgies modify the theory but without actually changing the underlying theory. This reflects the idea that as black holes are completely emptied in some quantum "branches"/instances or worlds in some superposition, no radiation can be generated so information must be represented as if the interior and the exterior share the same information - bulk-wise Hilbert space factorization change, again. However, the interior horizon vacuum version of semiclassicality may not be ensured according to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2024.139130 .
It could be said that replica wormholes actually correct "quantum states", given that gravitational path integrals are done in Euclidean time, corresponding to the breakdown of bulk Hilbert space factorization. The line between theory and states can be blurry, especially given that Euclidean QFTs may be the ones that provide the actual meaning of QFTs - at least mathematically rigorously. Cast in terms of real-time QFT, we could say that Euclidean QFTs properly correct Minkowski QFTs after analytic continuation. 
We know that path integrals (especially in Euclidean space) alone cannot justify unitarity and logical consistency, though the question is how would they be valid approximately. It can be easily seen that in case of theoretically pathological spacetime but empirically imaginable spacetime, we get non-unitary QFT that is allowed by path integrals but disallowed by established quantization procedures.
