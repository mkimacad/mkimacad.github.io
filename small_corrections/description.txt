header:On small corrections theorem
This paper discusses why the small corrections theorem is non-trivial, in terms of kinematic corrections (such as those involving eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) against dynamic corrections that the theorem touches on.
So you cannot use quantum gravity providing large corrections in the actual theory to evade the small corrections theorem.
