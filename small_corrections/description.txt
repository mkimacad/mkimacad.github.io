header:On small corrections theorem
This paper discusses why the small corrections theorem is non-trivial, in terms of kinematic corrections (such as those involving eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) against dynamic corrections that the theorem touches on.
So you cannot solely use quantum gravity providing large corrections in the actual theory to evade the small corrections theorem.
header:Revision idea
1. "EFT-like"/"QG-like" can also be replaced with "perturbative"/"nonperturbative" and everything still holds. This applicable for an interpretation of replica wormholes. 
header:Reminder - specific heat
Schwarzschild black hole's specific heat C has $C<0$. However, usually $C > 0$. How many results we transport from $C \geq 0$ cases to $C<0$?
header:trivia - JT gravity as ensemble (not in the paper)
If a JT gravity state is an ensemble state, then multiple "ground" or final evaporation states.
header:A candidate resolution of the information problem?
Considering classical gravity is an ensemble theory, we do not need to correct EFT - rather, we just need to correct for the "final evaporation" state - this works as high-energy corrections where classically, such emitted radiations would completely evaporate a black hole. This is a conceptually and computationally very difficult correction to achieve within EFT.
This is a "large correction" to EFT, but except for the "final evaporation" state, all other EFT outcomes remain evolving under EFT. It is the probability of the "final evaporation state" that becomes large as to provide large corrections around the Page time.
