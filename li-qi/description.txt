header:On mental causation
So a mathematical theory is like 'mental state', while a model is like 'physical state'.
This would subscribe us to a class of theories where there are physical multiplicity for a single mental state.. which seems to be the default nowadays.
A mental state would basically be like a sentence (describing some object) and a physical state would basically be like an object.
As with a mathematical theory, a sentence describing a physical state would prove some sentence describing a consequent physical state.
Each sentence can be considered a mental state, and therefore, there is overdetermination, but this is nothing problematic.
Mental and physical still describe different things, and mental states are more "fundamental" in that they describe what are fundamental.
After all, different physical states (different mathematical models) are consistent with the same mental state.
We 'experience' mental states (sentences), not objects, and this is why it seems that physical and mental seem so separated.
