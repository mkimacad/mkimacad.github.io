header:Common storyline 1: the question of temperature transitions
Bekenstein-Hawking temperature gets hotter as black holes evaporate.
This holds if the semiclassical Hawking picture is correct.
The problem is that after complete evaporation, we expect tranquility, so temperature goes from extremely hot to suddenly cold for the horizon vacuum behavior.
The empty black hole limit of Schwarzschild spacetime is just Minkowski spacetime. The former features lasting radiations at asymptotic infinity, while the latter features none of that.
The black hole information problem suggests this is indeed problematic, as we cannot uphold unitarity. A fix is required such that effective temperature eventually decreases at very-late-time evaporation.
