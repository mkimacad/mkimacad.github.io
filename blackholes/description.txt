Meanwhile my latest statement belongs to mkimacad.github.io/measurement + mkimacad.github.io/braneworld .
The former provides a (more) mature (and latest) understnading of black hole physics, especially JT gravity.

Anyway, what does one mean by resolving the information problem?
If Hilbert space factorization breakdown resolves the information problem, did we really resolve it?

If bulk EFT is an ensemble theory, and if it has to be heavily corrected for an actual bulk theory,
did we resolve the information problem?
(early-time evaporaton, ensemble theory approximately = ensemble theory)
(late-time evaporation, ensemble theory \= or != actual theory)
