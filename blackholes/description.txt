header:Common storyline 1: the question of temperature transitions
Bekenstein-Hawking temperature gets hotter as black holes evaporate.
This holds if the semiclassical Hawking picture is correct.
The problem is that after complete evaporation, we expect tranquility, so temperature goes from extremely hot to suddenly cold for the horizon vacuum behavior.
The empty black hole limit of Schwarzschild spacetime is just Minkowski spacetime. The former features lasting radiations at asymptotic infinity, while the latter features none of that.
The black hole information problem suggests this is indeed problematic, as since unitarity cannot be upheld. A fix is required such that effective temperature eventually decreases at very-late-time evaporation.
header:Common storyline 2: a unique no-hair ground state: the empty black hole branch
The conventional expectation is that the no-hair principle largely holds for black holes even in quantum contexts.
One way to interpret this, combined with restoration of pure state evolution and unitarity for the black hole exterior, is that the empty Schwarzschild black hole state is uniquely given.
Even without the no-hair principle, the intuition is that there is nothing inside the empty Schwarzschild black hole so its state should be unique if we continue to have interior-exterior effective field theory factorization.
This is the key to demonstrating unitarity of the black hole exterior in the JCM model of black holes.
header:Common storyline 3: three versions of semiclassical effective field theory (semiclassical EFT)
The argument in the JCM model is that we have to distinguish two (and eventually three) semiclassicality:
A) mostly classical stability of background spacetime when viewed from the black hole exterior,
B) conventional semiclassical EFT (Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity) - EFT on background spacetime obtained by averaging out stress-energy tensor.
A) holds, while B) eventually breaks down for late-time evaporation.
The reason why conventional semiclassical EFT breaks down is that as aforementioned, Minkowski spacetime and Schwarzschild spacetime differ in terms of lasting radiations at asymptotic infinity. While we obtain Minkowski as the zero Schwarzschild radius limit of Schwarzschild spacetime, the former is not obtained as the zero-temperature limit of the latter.
The JCM model suggests that we can safely handle all sorts of hairs and microstates within the black hole interior, but once we have a unique ground state of the black hole interior, then the black hole is forced to evaporate into the ground state, which means zero entanglement entropy.
But there is another version of semiclassicality, which says:
C) for black holes, we can safely apply EFT on each spacetime outcome, and form a superposition linearly. This continues to hold in the JCM model, and strictly quantum-gravitational calculations are unnecessary - EFT is fine.
For A), we use the fact that black evaporation is a slow process involving extremely many effective "qubits". The central limit theorem then affords us normal distributions for small intervals, resulting in a largely classical description up to normal distribution variances - see the JCM model github page. Furthermore after the entanglement entropy turnaround point, variance has to start decreasing, which limits deviations from the average outcome. The calculation involves the total energy emitted up to some time t.
header:Common storyline 4: black hole paradoxes arise due to degrees of freedom double counting in EFT with a black hole
See 'the analysis for the apologia paper' github page initially as well.
The double counting understanding is essentially what is argued by the holography of information view. Proponents have, I think, successfully demonstrated that while quantum gravity does have some differences from conventional gauge theories, the Gauss law principle applies for gravity as well such that we can measure effectively non-locally from asymptotic infinity (such as null infinity).
Non-perturbatively, a diffeomorphism-invariance quantum gravity observables cannot be local. However, the islands view suggests that perturbatively at each perturbation order, we can dress a local operator around a Wilson line such that local treatments remain and gauge invariance is not broken at each order.
Nevertheless, eventually islands suggest that this local EFT treatment commits to double counting with visible effects, and we have to take out extra degrees of freedom - "islands," "replica wormholes" are all about taking extra dofs out.
header:(In relation to the common storyline 4:) Different paths toward the empty black hole branch, but no hair at the end
There are many paths for a black hole to become empty. The "average expectation" (conventional) semiclassical EFT on the interior assumes that it remembers all these paths.
We do not have to assume that paths are forgotten before the black hole is emptied, but once the black hole is emptied, then the conventional semiclassical EFT is wrong, and these paths have to be forgotten completely, existing only as part of exterior radiations.
If we do not modify EFT, then states or Hilbert space factorization has to be modified. Within the holographic bulk EFT, this gives an illusion of non-unitarity or non-linearity.
header:(In relation to the common storyline 4:) On a black hole implementation of quantum thermal search (QTS)
The idea behind QTS is to throw (the initial state of) system $S$ into a black hole. $S$ alone has Hamiltonian that depends on a given search problem. If every feasible input has same search results, then every state has same energy. If not, then there are ground states with energy different from excited states. If the black hole exterior $EXT$ has temperature colder than $S$, then heat and energy should flow out of $S$ to $EXT$.
In QTS contexts, black holes serve to provide an interaction mechanism between $S$ and $EXT$ that does not care about the Hilbert space and Hamiltonian details of $S$.
The only thing the interaction really cares about is whether $EXT$ exhausted all the energy to its ground state.
If every state of $S$ has same energy, then there is no further evaporation than what the black hole without $EXT$ would have evaporated. If not, then there is additional evaporation, providing an implementation of QTS.
This relies on the assumption that there is double counting of (infalling) $S$ in the black hole exterior and the interior.
If this double counting is not the case, then $S$ newly falling into the black hole interior $IN$ is stated as absorbing the ground energy of $S$ as well according to the interior Hamiltonian $H_{IN}$. In such a case, however, the Hamiltonian information of $S$ would be lost after evaporation. This loss of information actually becomes worse for easy search problems, which suggests that double counting should be there.
header:Common storyline 5: on gravity quantization
It is often said that collapse mechanisms can allow for "average expectation"-type Møller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity such that gravity does not need to be quantized.
But the (Møller-Rosenfeld-)Hawking picture of black hole evaporation and the JCM model offer two contrasting pictures of black hole evaporation that do not involve measurements. The former results in a final mixed state for the black hole exterior, whereas the latter results in a final pure state.
This arises due to the assumed nature of quantum gravity. Does gravity respond to each non-gravitational quantum outcome? Møller-Rosenfeld-Hawking says we can proceed if the answer is no. The JCM model says the answer is yes, even if gravity is not yet fully quantized.
header:Common storyline 6: on Page curve
Holography of information says that quantum gravity's observables are different from non-gravitational theory's observables.
While quantum gravity is different from typical gauge theories, they share the Gauss law. Information is at asymptotic infinity (such as null infinity).
This is very likely true. However, unitarity of quantum physics and AdS/CFT does not resolve the information problem.
To resolve the information problem, we need to show what happens around the black hole horizon where we still expect non-gravitational EFT (on curved background spacetime) to mostly work.
This is why the Page curve given in terms of non-gravitational observables is so important. 
(See sidenote.txt in this sub-repo as well for storyline 4 and 5 in relevance to the braneworld paper.)
header:Slightly different views about the small corrections theorem within my papers
If we believe that information on a black hole is actually encoded in its horizon, then assumed local interaction behaviors change. This should be the case for double holography, which allows us to evade the small corrections theorem. (The braneworld paper view)
However, such full holography is actually unnecessary, and we only need to properly account for the empty black hole outcome to escape the small corrections theorem. (The JCM model paper view)
